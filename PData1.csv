The Balfour Declaration and it’s Consequences
The Balfour Declaration, published November 2nd, 1917, impacted Palestine by leading to a mistrust of Europe, particularly Great Britain, by both Jews and Arabs, causing an internal division, and by increasing the rate and intensity of the Zionist movement. These effects were felt immediately after the declaration was published and are still being felt today.  The declaration is letter that was sent by Britain’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild, one of the leaders of British Jews. The letter was very brief, containing only sixty seven words. It also contradicted itself. It goes as follows: 
I have much pleasure in conveying to you, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet.
His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.
I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.
        A mistrust of Europe, Great Britain in particular, was one of the effects of the Balfour Declaration. This effect was not felt immediately by the Jews, however it was by the Arabs. The Balfour Declaration contradicted an earlier agreement between the British and Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca, known as the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence. The Correspondence was a series of letters exchanged between Hussein and Sir Henry McMahon, British High Commissioner in Egypt. The letters say that Britain will support Arab independence if they revolt against the Ottoman Empire. “Under the assumption of British support for Arab independence as discussed in the letters, Hussein led the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire that began on 5 June 1916.”(Gemer 1) When Britain did not support Arab independence after this, and instead supported the Zionists in their goal to create a national home for Jewish people, the Arabs felt betrayed. This was not the only time they felt betrayal by the British in the course of this all, another time was with Hogarth’s Message, which was supposed to clarify the Balfour Declaration. In Hogarth’s Message, Hussein was was promised that the Arab race was going to have a complete opportunity of forming a nation and that the Jewish would not control Palestine. “Hogarth gave him a solemn pledge that Britain would respect not only the economic but also the political freedom of the Arab population. When Britain subsequently refused to recognize Arab independence in Palestine, Hussein felt betrayed and accused Britain of breach of faith.”(Shlaim 3) The Balfour Declaration resulted in anger towards Britain throughout the Arab world. According to Professor Avi Shlaim, “The hostility of the Arab nationalists towards Britain on account of the Balfour Declaration was immediate and unremitting.”(Shlaim 3) Bernard Wasserstein says that the Arabs had a lot of suspicion and mistrust of the British-Zionist relationship in Palestine, which remained for the thirty years of British control. In addition to Arab mistrust, the declaration lead to Jewish mistrust of Europe. This happened after the British admitted that they were unable to secure the creation of a Jewish National Home as well as give the Arabs self government in a report by a Royal Commission, lead by Earl Peel. The Jews also felt betrayed in February 1947 when the Mandate for Palestine was vetoed by the United Nations. The Mandate stated that there was to be a national home for Jewish people, so imagine their feelings of anger and mistrust to Britain when they were informed that this was to no longer happen. “The Balfour Declaration in favour of Zionism was gradually diluted and ultimately betrayed by Great Britain.”(Herbert Samuel and the Palestine Problem  1) Zionists believed that the British had backslid on their promise to the Jews. “The facts of the situation are that in the dire straits of the war, the British Government made promises to the Arabs and promises to the Jews which are inconsistent with one another and are incapable of fulfilment.”(Shlaim 9) Sir John Chancellor stated this regarding the Balfour Declaration and its failure. He also admits that it was unfair to the Arabs. All in all, both Arabs and Jews felt let down by Great Britain, and both accused Britain of betrayal and deceitfulness.
 Another effect of the Balfour Declaration was that it caused an internal division in Palestine between the Arabs and the Jews. A main cause for this was Sir Herbert Samuel’s attempt to satisfy the needs of the Arabs and the Jews separately, after failed attempts to bring them together under a unified political framework. In the short term, this alleviated inter-communal conflicts, but if you look at the big picture, you can see that this process increased the already existing problem of a feeling of separation between the Jews and Arabs and drove them further apart. As you can imagine, the reason for this is that if two groups are not given the same rules and policies, they feel as though they are entirely different, even if they exist in the same nation. From that, they begin, or continue to, alienate one another. Sir Herbert Samuel did not believe his policy should be, but he understood its benefits. He said, “The recent Palestine events have lead to many acquiesce out of resentment in a policy of alienation, feeling that the two races between which events of such tragic significance had taken place, must draw apart in greater and greater degree.”(JTA 1) The partition of Palestine into an Arab section and Jewish section was even proposed twice, once by Britain and once by the United Nations. Both were made in an effort to solve the problems they realized the Balfour Declaration had caused and was still causing. The proposal by Britain was suggested by the Royal Commision. In their report, they said “Under the stress of the World War the British Government made promises to Arabs and Jews in order to obtain their support. On the strength of those promises both parties formed certain expectations. . . . An irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national communities within the narrow bounds of one small country. . . . There is no common ground between them. . . . This conflict was inherent in the situation from the outset. . . . We cannot—in Palestine as it is now—both concede the Arab claim of self-government and secure the establishment of the Jewish National Home.”(Shlaim 10) They proposed the division of Palestine to solve the conflicts, which did not go over well will the Arabs. There had already been a strike going on the year before by the Arab Higher Committee trying to stop Jewish immigration and stop the sale of land to Jews and in effort to establish an independent national government. The Arabs went into a full scale rebellion, known as the Arab Rebellion of 1936-39. On November 2nd, 1947, the United Nations voted to have Palestine divided into an Arab state and a Jewish State. The Jewish people accepted this but Arabs viewed it as illegal, immoral and impractical. They thought it was ignoring the rights of the majority of Palestine, the Arabs, which it was in fact since the division gave 56.47% of the land to the Jews, the minority. The proposal for the partition of mandatory Palestine lead to a civil war. These are all reasons why Palestine ended up to be internally divided. 
One more effect of the declaration was the increased rate and intensity of the Zionist movement. This occurred by protecting and encouraging Zionists in their effort and main goal of establishing a national Jewish home in Palestine. “It gave legitimate ground to Zionism which had not gained mass acceptance until then, even within the Jews around the world. It resulted in the establishment of a Jewish state of Israel after thirty years, which used force and violence to displace a large proportion of the indigenous Arab population from Palestine.”(Impact of the Balfour Declaration 1) Also, it gave Jews a sense of superiority over the Arabs. Sir John Chancellor said that “Even as a minority of the population of Palestine the Jews adapt towards the Arabs and attitude of arrogant superiority, which is hotly resented by the Arabs with their traditions of courtesy and good manners.”(Shlaim 9) The declaration also gave way to increased Jewish migration to Palestine. More Jews wanted to move there as a national Jewish home had been promised. The migrations increased in more during World War II in an effort to escape anti-semitism and holocaust in Europe. 
Overall, the Balfour Declaration was devastating to Arabs, Jews and even the British. It lead to mistrust of Europe, the internal division in Palestine and increased Zionist movement. Elizabeth Monroe argues that “it is one of the greatest mistake in our(British) imperial history.”(Shlaim 2) The Balfour Declaration “gave rise to one of the most intense, bitter, and protracted conflicts of modern times.”(Shaim 13) The Balfour Declaration is the main reason for the Arab-Israeli Conflict."

Tolerance, Feminism, and the Downside of Globalization Within Voltaire’s Candide
        During the Enlightenment, works such as Candide increased the amount of people who began to feel skeptical about their church, government, and philosophies. Candide was published in 1759 by a French philosophe named Francois-Marie Arout, known more commonly by his pen name, Voltaire. The book follows a young man named Candide in his quest to marry Cunegonde, the beautiful daughter of a German baron. Candide is hit with many obstacles throughout his quest, from being forced to join the Bulgar army, to encountering the utopian society of El Dorado, to nearly being eaten by cannibals. All the while Candide continuously runs into his old tutor Pangloss in many unfortunate situations. Pangloss has contracted syphilis, been sold into slavery, and was nearly dissected over the course of the book. Despite these events, he refuses to lose faith in his philosophy that the world they live in is the best of all possible worlds. Together, Pangloss’s philosophy and misfortune are meant to be satirical of the Enlightenment thinker G.W. von Leibniz’s view that the world we live in is perfect (Look). In the end of Candide, Candide finally is given the chance to marry Cunegonde. However, by this time Cunegonde has become very ugly and Candide has no desire to marry her now other than for the sake of his pride. Satire, vernacular, and Voltaire’s famous wit allow Candide to be understood by the common folk of the time, therefore allowing its ideas to spread to very far. 
Since Voltaire touches on so many subjects in Candide, contemporary critics have a choice of many different positions to argue in regards of the main purpose and the book. Doctor Ingvild Hagen Kjorholt, a lecturer in the Department of Scandinavian Studies and Comparative Literature at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, chose to focus on the impact of globalization on cosmopolitans versus slaves in her article “Cosmopolitans, Slaves, and the Global Market in Voltaire’s Candide, ou l’optimisme.” She argues that both the slave and the cosmopolitan of the eighteenth century are citizens of the world, but in completely different ways. As stated by Kjorholt in her abstract, “these two juxtaposed characters represent radically different results of globalization.” The cosmopolitan, or world citizen, was the embodiment of Enlightenment ideals who saw the whole world as his homeland and moves freely from city to city. Just like the cosmopolitan, the slave also moves about from city to city. However, his moves are chosen for him and he is not a free entity. Helena Feder, a graduate professor at the University of California Davis, took a very different approach than Doctor Kjorholt in her critique and analyzation of Candide. In her article “The Critical Relevance of the Critique of Rationalism: Postmodernism, Ecofeminism, and Voltaire’s Candide,” Feder attempts to show how Voltaire’s critique of rationalism is linked to the ecofeminist critique of it. In doing so, she explicitly points out how the women in Candide carry more knowledge than some of the educated men, thereby stressing Voltaire’s view that women were not beneath men intellectually. However, although Candide does touch on globalization and feminism as Kjorholt and Feder write about, Voltaire’s main purpose for writing it was to parody the philosophy of optimism proposed by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibnitz and therefore denounce religious persecution and advocate for religious toleration. 
When Candide was being written, politics, science, and the philosophies of Europe were being reoriented by the Enlightenment, or the Age of Reason. The Enlightenment was a time period in which science was becoming more available to the general public and travel literature was becoming more common. Science began to be taught in a way that was intended to reach those who were not intellectuals. For example, Bernard de Fontenelle, the secretary of the French Royal Academy of Science taught readers about the advances in cosmology in his book Plurality of Worlds by  presenting the lesson as an intimate conversation between two of the characters. Because of people like Fontenelle, science was now a part of common literature rather than something reserved for only experts in the field. Travel literature were books that gave accounts of foreign cultures and were written by traders, missionaries, medical professionals, and explorers. These books shed light on developed civilizations around the world that had different customs than the European states. Seeing that there were other cultures around the world that had customs unlike those of Europe made Europeans realize that what practices they thought had been grounded in reason were really just matters of custom. A new and larger following of science combined with exposure to prosperous foreign nations through travel literature lead to a new sort of skepticism. This skepticism caused people to question both their religion and their government. Intellectuals of the Enlightenment, most commonly known by the French term philosophes, sought to explain the world using Newton’s rules of reasoning and to change it for the better. The rejection of traditional Christianity was also very common among philosophes. This most likely stemmed from them being alienated during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries due to religious intolerance and wars. Alos, many of them were especially influenced by John Locke’s theory of knowledge. As written in his “Essay Concerning Human Understanding,” Locke claims that every person is born with a blank mind and it is the person’s observations that shape how they think. He begins by raising a question: “Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas. How comes it to be furnished?” His answer resides in human experience: “To this I answer, in one word, from experience… (qtd. in J. Spielvogel 466).” However, this does not go to say that all philosophes had the same views, values, and goals. Many of them did not agree with each other at all. What they did have in common though, was their call for freedom of expression. Most of them lived with the state censoring their works and therefore not allowing all of their ideas to reach the general public. Philosophes managed to find loopholes in censorship though, and their works, such as Candide, began to circulate and a huge impact on western society. 
In her article “Cosmopolitans, Slaves, and the Global Market in Voltaire’s Candide, ou l’optimisme,” Kjorholt focuses on the tragedies of globalization hinted at in Candide. She points out that “the cosmopolitan or world citizen was an ideal among the Enlightenment philosophes” (62). This is true, philosophes believed that experience gave one knowledge. Since travel is considered experience, the more traveled one was meant the more regarded they were as an intellectual. However, one tends to forget the consequences that resulted of the increasingly global world or the eighteenth century. Many natives of the areas where Europeans had been taking over were subjected to disease, sold into slavery, and taken advantage of in many other regards. Kjorholt addresses Voltaire’s choice to have Candide go to Surinam. In the midst of the eighteenth century, the Dutch colony of Surinam was known for extremely high death rate of slaves (72). Kjorholt holds the belief that “Surinam’s function is to underline a fundamental interconnectedness between the Old and New World - a common infrastructure resulting in the global spread of diseases, a global economy, and global wars (73).” Candide’s encounter with the slave in Surinam “implies a confrontation between two different global identities”: the European cosmopolitan and the African slave (73). As a cosmopolitan, Candide is free to move around the world as he pleases. In contrast, the slave is not free and is subject to his master’s will. He blames the European empire and colonialism for his confinement. Kjorholt also points out that the voyages that Candide and other characters in the novel take outline the political borders of imperial Europe (63). This is an interesting observation which fits in nicely with her belief that Candide was critiquing the globalization of Europe. 
While Doctor Kjorholt pointed out Voltaire’s criticism of globalization in Candide, Helena Feder reviewed the book from a feminist standpoint in her article “The Critical Relevance of the Critique of Rationalism: Postmodernism, Ecofeminism, and Voltaire’s Candide.” Focusing on the old woman, she points out how the females in Candide are characterized as being much more intelligent than the men. The old woman in Candide is very wise. She draws most of her knowledge from experience, something that philosophes believed gave one knowledge. Feder says that “she is shown to be both wiser than Pangloss (who represents optimism) and Martin [...] (205).” At a time when women were still viewed as inferior to men, this portrayal of a woman was quite bold. Voltaire was perhaps poking fun at how ridiculous the treatment of women was during the eighteenth century with his characterization of the old woman. Feder argues that the old woman in the story “is the only character in the tale, aside from Candide, who achieves a modicum of wisdom (204).” Since most men during the eighteenth century believed that women were incapable of intelligence, reading this during that time must have been very shocking to male readers. Feder does an excellent job of pointing out the purposeful strengths of the women in Candide to support her feminist take on the novel. 
The stance against religious intolerance in Candide is obvious in his characterization of the Anabaptist and predictable since he was known for advocating religious toleration. One example in Candide of Voltaire’s support for religious tolerance is making an Anabaptist a hero to Candide (Redman 235). In this scene, Candide has been treated very badly by a husband and wife who believe that the pope is the antichrist. They ask Candide if he believes the pope is the antichrist as well, and when he replies that he does not know, they dump human waste on his head. After this, Candide is taken under the care of an Anabaptist named Jacques. Candide tells the Anabaptist that he is vastly more touched by his extreme generosity than the harshness of the gentleman in the black cloak and his good lady (236). Showing the kindness of an Anabaptist at this time was most likely in an effort to shed light on the fact that even if someone is not the same religion as the masses, they can still be a good person. Anabaptists had been persecuted in Europe from the beginning due to their beliefs differing so much from those of Protestants and Catholics. In this section of Candide, Voltaire is trying to make a point that a person’s religion does not define whether or not they have a good heart. He is also trying to say that people can all get along despite different religious views. Kjorholt points out another instance in Candide where Voltaire criticizes religion. She points out that the Negro slave in Candide addresses a “double standard by showing how the slaves are treated worse than animals, while at the same time being instructed to dedicate themselves to a Christian God since they, like every man, descend from Adam (75).” In this line Kjorholt is referencing Louis XIV’s Code Noir, a decree that forced slaves in French colonies to convert to Catholicism. By pointing out the double standard of slaves in French colonies as an effect of Code Noir, Voltaire is attacking Louis XIV’s corrupt use of religion to gain and maintain power throughout his kingdom in his absolutist philosophy of one king, one religion. By satirizing religious intolerance and pointing out the corruption within organized religion, Voltaire is advocating for religious toleration. 
        In short, Voltaire’s Candide managed to critique many aspects of eighteenth century society. From promoting feminism, to advocating for religious toleration, to exposing the underside of globalization, Voltaire manages to reach a wide range of European citizens with Candide and makes them rethink their morals."

Following many hours of travel—flying, then driving the winding roads of La Falda, Argentina—and a long-overdue night of rest, I was awoken by the sound of my tía’s many dogs barking outside my window. Eager to experience a day of normal Argentine life, I threw the hand-quilted blankets to the foot of the bed and walked down the rickety, wooden hallways to find the kitchen.
My grandfather appeared from the shadows of the house carrying a large, beat up cardboard box. He rested it on a table that was already littered with gourds of sweet, caffeine-rich maté, baskets of bread crackers, and dollops of thick dulce de leche. When he opened the lid, the kitchen filled with dust, and the sound of coughing and wheezing from my grandparents, mother, aunt, and cousins filled the room until the dust settled. 
        We passed the gourd around the table, trying to keep the bombilla in place. Each person took a sip, then passed it to the next. My tía, Norita, who has been living in this brightly painted house since she was young, reached into the box and began to pass photos around the table. 
Faces looked out at me from the old black-and-white photos, as if inspecting and appraising me,  and welcoming me into the past. Photos of my grandfather were shared and laughed at, as this was the first time we had ever seen pictures of him this young. Soon, though, what was at first a time of joy and reminiscing turned into one of tears and sadness, as the faces of so many late ancestors continued to appear. My mother passed me a photo of my grandfather sitting on the blood-soaked counter of a butcher shop, and through her tears she explained to me that he grew up on the dirt floors of the room connected to the back of this shop, which his father and mother ran as their family business.  
        It was only now that I realized that I, too, had tears rolling down my face. How could my grandfather have created the life he was living now from inside the unforgiving walls of a butcher shop? Yet every day, he was content with life. He surrounded himself with the people he loved, and who loved him back, and he pursued the things that made him happy. 
        After this, I saw every place we visited in Argentina with a new perspective. In Buenos Aires, we visited a different branch of the family. Compared to the rest of the city, they lived in poverty. Stray dogs ruled the streets and each entryway into each sour-smelling house was protected only by a tattered mosquito net. Still, my cousins seemed content. 
        Before this trip, I had already been proud of my Spanish and South American heritage, but seeing where my family had been built made me feel even more honored to be a part of it. The traditions I had grown up with began to make sense now that I had been able to see their origins and importance firsthand. 
The classical and tango music I grew up with, which was played at all hours of the day. My meat-heavy school lunches, which seemed so foreign to my friends. Our family gatherings, where we stayed up into the early hours of the morning talking, laughing, and sharing memories. 
While I am proud of the things I have achieved in school, nothing can compare to how proud I am to be a part of this unique family. These people, along with the background and traditions they have passed down me, have made me who I am. And it is these people, sitting around their old, worn wooden table, who will cheer me on as I take each new step in this world. Many things will change in the coming years, but that never will.

The Role of Setting in “Disgrace”,"Schapansky

The Role of Setting in “Disgrace”
        Published in 1999, J.M. Coetzee’s novel revolves around protagonist, David Lurie, who encounters many scenes of disgrace throughout his life. Disgrace covers the uncomfortable issues of sexual assault and oppression of women in the developing setting of post-apartheid South Africa. Coetzee depicts each setting uniquely, showing how even minute variances in history and tradition can influence the distribution of power given to people of different positions in the social hierarchy. Throughout the novel Disgrace, author J.M. Coetzee explores the importance of setting in defining and demonstrating the themes of sexual assault and gender oppression in the eyes of the main character, David Lurie.
        Beginning in Cape Town, Coetzee opens the audience’s perception of David by explaining David’s weekly routine and his history with women, with regard to the environment he lives in. He feels no shame bringing their relationship out into public, where Soraya consequently reaches her breaking point and discontinues all connections with David. Once his relationship with Soraya is drawn to a close, Lurie is left alone, searching for another method to please himself and his sexual desires. David feels empty without Soraya, as stated by Coetzee, “Without the Thursday interludes the week is as featureless as a desert. There are days when he does not know what to do with himself” (Coetzee 10). The author has created a society in which the sincere disappointment due to lack of sexual activity is standard for men, and continues to develop this idea throughout the remainder of David’s time in Cape Town.
Coetzee reinforces this normality very quickly by introducing Melanie Isaacs, a student of Lurie’s, in his Romantics class, and showcasing Lurie’s immediate interest in her. Hesitantly, following brief conversation, Melanie agrees to meet David inside of his home for dinner. Although no physical assault takes place during their first encounter, David undoubtedly takes advantage of her and her uncertainty concerning their relationship. The following time they meet, Coetzee emphasizes how David enjoys her hesitation by highlighting that, “he makes love to her [...] though she is passive throughout, he finds the act pleasurable, so pleasurable that from its climax he tumbles into blank oblivion” (Coetzee 16). Here, Coetzee emphasizes that David takes additional pleasure from the idea that Melanie is reluctant concerning their relationship. The author notes that “if she has gotten away with much, he has got away with more; if she is behaving badly, he has behaved worse” (Coetzee 26). Lurie does not care to consider the consequences of his actions at this moment, but he also does not judge whether or not his actions are moral in the long-term. Coetzee fortifies David’s feeling of supremacy in Cape Town by giving detail of David’s actions and current mindset, offering the idea that David Lurie understands his standing in the social hierarchy. 
        Adding onto David’s preconceived image of his own superiority, when Melanie brings the assault into the attention of the college, David does not defend himself and, surprisingly, accepts the decision to be banished to Eastern Cape where his daughter resides. David, himself, does not declare that what he had done was wrong or cruel, but rather merely accepts the opinions of those within his trial and welcomes his punishment without argument. In fact, Lurie states that “I am a grown man. I am not receptive to being counseled. I am beyond the reach of counseling” (Coetzee 47). David is so overwhelmed with his own power that he refuses to receive assistance from anyone. Although he understands the actions he committed were unjust, he thinks highly enough of himself so that he believes his actions are not worth fixing. Similar to David’s life in Cape Town before the hearing, Lurie is overcome with the idea that “a woman’s body does not belong to her alone. It is a part of the bounty she brings into the world. She has a duty to share it” (Coetzee 15). This expands on Coetzee’s depiction of David in how he views women only as physical objects to be used by men in satisfying their sexual needs. The prioritization and idolization of white men in Cape Town almost normalize and justify David’s actions towards the women he encounters and sexually assaults. 
        Once David moves to Eastern Cape to live with his alienated daughter, however, his perceptions and outlook on sexual assault change entirely. As noted by David Atwell, “His confinement was not only self-alienating, an experience to which prison narratives often attest; it also brought about a collapse of the author’s revolutionary aspirations, which until then had thrived in the absence of any actual contact with the peasantry” (Atwell 230). David Lurie relocates to a place where instead white men are no longer given priority, rather, he is the outcast in this new setting. Quickly into the adjustment to his new home, David and Lucy are violently attacked; David is set on fire and Lucy is sexually assaulted. Shortly after his treatment and the start of his healing process, Lurie admits “He has a sense that, inside him, a vital organ has been bruised, abused - perhaps even his heart” (Coetzee 105). Simply in this rendition of abuse, David is already beginning to realize his loss of power and influence.  In post-apartheid South Africa, there still remains revenge and anger for past injustices while the whites were in power. This postcolonial type- setting explains why Lucy and David see her sexual assault as an act of hate (rather than that of solely sexual desire), considering that the two of them make up for a majority of the whites living in the area. Lucy claimed that “It was so personal [...] It was done with such personal hatred [...] why did they hate me so?” (Coetzee 153). On one hand, Lucy believes that it was an act of purely personal hate, that she had done wrong to the men who assaulted her. However, David suggests that it was a remnant of the injustices of South Africa in the past, where people such as Lucy and David oppressed people like the attackers. He comforts Lucy by saying, “It was history speaking through them [...] A history of wrong [...] It may have seemed personal, but it wasn’t. It came down from the ancestors” (Coetzee 153). David’s outlook on sexual assault and the oppression of women has drastically changed in comparison to his original outlook from when he resided in Cape Town.  The direct and immediate shift in social structure forces Lurie to step back and view his decisions from an outside perspective. This change in setting alone assists Coetzee in conveying his theme of how sexual assault and oppression of women are treated differently in locations with contrasting histories.
Opposite to David’s original outlook on sexual assault, Lurie looks for assistance in finding and punishing the criminals who sexually assaulted Lucy. Unfortunately, he learns that he will earn justice only by simply voicing their truth into words for others to hear, and nothing more. Lurie is forced to accept this system. Lucy refuses to speak on what was inflicted upon her, whereas David desperately begs her to speak the truth and receive justice for these actions and to move back to Cape Town with him, where she will live a more conventional lifestyle. He wants to criminalize the men that both assaulted him and raped Lucy, but he must learn to accept the verbalization of these crimes to his peers as justice enough. It is through David’s acceptance of the fact that he will never receive the justice that he hopes for, or understand the reason for why he and Lucy were assaulted, which finally allow him to understand that he is the only one accountable for his personal responsibility. Lurie learns that “true reconciliation” can only be achieved “if one is willing to see one’s own blame in the situation at hand” (McCoppin 54). It is in combination with the new definition of superiority in this new location that David’s realization of true justice fully overtakes his past mindset. David Lurie is now able to compare his past life in Cape Town with his newfound life in the countryside. Coetzee uses the abrupt change in setting and social hierarchy to demonstrate the differences in how rape and gender oppression are viewed in different physical locations.
        A minor setting in which the audience is able to view distinct changes in the treatment of oppression and sexual assault is Bev Shaw’s animal clinic. Here, David is given the job of assisting Bev in euthanizing unwanted dogs. He lies with the dogs on the floor and comforts the dogs until their soul leaves their body, later transporting their bagged remains to the incinerator and saying goodbye to them. Coetzee emphasizes how David and the dogs are alike in the sense that they are both unwanted; that when dogs are brought to the clinic, the owners hope to “dispose of it, make it disappear, dispatch it to oblivion”, just like Cape Town wished of David (Coetzee 139). However, in this setting, David is able to show respect and mercy to those of his kind, hoping that one day someone will show the same respect to him. In this minor setting, similar to that of the environment created in Eastern Cape, David is inflicted with a new social structure, this one by which David matches with those at the lowest level. Just like the dogs, David is unwanted. By spending time in the clinic with Bev, David finally grasps how the actions of others can impact the feelings of an individual, and this realization brought to David through this depressing setting contributes to David’s outlook on understanding others and Coetzee’s overall theme of rape and gender oppression.
Once David returns to Cape Town, it is obvious to see how the differences in the distribution of power and oppression reflect on his outlook of assault. Lurie reconsiders and revises his perception of reconciliation to match the culture around him. He now understands that “true reconciliation can only come about if one is willing to see one’s own blame in the situation at hand” (McCoppin 54). After not only being the victim of assault in the countryside but now seeing and understanding how the power shifts in the social hierarchy, David repurposes his old views on sexual assault. He meets with Melanie Isaacs’ family and attempts to apologize. Earlier in the novel, Lurie was accepting of the punishment he had received, but he now yearns for forgiveness in realizing that his objectification of women is wrong. Once he enters the Isaacs’ home, he understands the controversy over the actions he made in the past and is immediately uncomfortable in the presence of Melanie’s family, the women in particular. David, after experiencing the change in setting, finally admits that he is “sorry for what I took your daughter through [...] I apologize for the grief I have caused you and Mrs. Isaacs. I ask for your pardon” (Coetzee 168). Through analyzing the change in setting, one can see how Coetzee directly emphasizes the importance of historical background and social structure and the effect that they can have on the culture’s outlook on gender oppression and sexual assault.
        To conclude, through each different setting used within Disgrace, Coetzee exemplified his theme of rape and the oppression of women in post-apartheid South Africa, specifically through the eyes of protagonist, David Lurie. By using Cape Town as one of his main settings, the audience was able to accurately understand David’s true personality; encompassed with the feeling of privilege and entitlement, with no concern to the emotions and feelings of those around him, especially women. Cape Town allowed white men to be at the top of the social hierarchy, which allowed David to carry out his actions without consequence or regret. However, once David was expelled from Cape Town and moved to the countryside with his daughter, Lucy, he noticed how power was distributed differently and therefore left him and his daughter, who made up for most of the white population in the area, at the bottom of the structure. His encounter with assault along with the other minor settings within the countryside allowed David to return to his own home, where he was much more comfortable with the culture and the history, and realize his wrongdoings, and eventually, apologize for them. Each of the settings in J.M. Coetzee’s Disgrace contributes to depicting how women in South Africa are objectified and are taken advantage of by the men in the society, which allow Coetzee to effectively communicate his theme clearly and bring attention to the issues associated with rape culture and oppression.

Designer Babies
        If given the chance to choose the sex, physique and character traits of your future child, would you? With technology advancing as rapidly as it is, choosing the genetic makeup of children is not too far in the future. Couples are already able to choose embryos which are deemed the healthiest, which do not have or are least likely to develop genetic disorders or diseases, and are the gender which they prefer. People have been arguing for years about whether or not this is moral and if it should be legal. As technology keeps advancing, society needs to educate themselves about designer babies so they can help decide if this is something they want in the world.  TThe ability to genetically engineer humans had come from years of research and advancement in fertility techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and is still very new. The introduction of genetically engineered humans could divide society and dehumanize those who were genetically engineered, and that is why we should not do so. However, if society does decide to go ahead and engineer humans, much more research and tests need to be done.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a designer baby as “a baby selected by prenatal testing to ensure the presence or absence of particular genes or characteristics (Agar “Designer Babies: Ethical Considerations”).” The idea of designer babies has been around for a very long time, but only recently has it moved from science fiction to what could be a reality. The problem with genetically manipulating humans is that we are unsure of the effects it will have on the beings who have their genetic makeup artificially engineered, and how it will change society in the long run. Some also worry that allowing parents to choose exactly how they want their children to look and be like will turn babies into a consumer good, which will inturn dehumanize them (Baird, 14). 
        In the article ‘Designer’ Humans, David Masci, a specialist in science, religion and foreign policy issues, goes over how we have come to be able to even think about creating these designer humans. People first learned about genetic manipulation in 1866, when an Austrian monk by the name of Gregor Mendel first wrote about the basic laws of genetic inheritance from what he learned from breeding peas in his garden (Masci 431). From then we have advanced to discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), creating “test tube babies” through invitro fertilization, cloning animals, genetically altering a primate, and more (Masci 431). Nazi Germany tried to use eugenics to create a dominant race but ended up killing millions during the time of the Holocaust (Masci 426). That is why some people are highly against genetically engineering humans, they fear something like this will happen again. 
        In his article Designer Babies: Eugenics Repackaged or Consumer Options? Stephen L. Baird, a technology education teacher, explains that the reason designer babies are even a possibility is due to advanced reproductive technologies, cell and chromosome manipulation, and genetics and genomics (15). As science progresses, it provides us with more opportunities to advance our species. We will soon be able to genetically engineer our offspring because of this. Scientists are already able to genetically manipulate other creatures. Examples of this include mice with the genes of jellyfish that can glow in the dark (Baird 13), or ANDi, “the world’s first genetically altered primate (Masci 427).” According to Iain Brassington, a bioethics professor at the University of Manchester, these technologies will “allow humanity to achieve in a generation or two what might take natural selection a millennia in respect of the elimination of certain diseases and the increase in desirable traits such as intelligence (395).” In the same article, Brassington goes on to say that these technologies may be able to instil desirable characteristics that would most likely never occur naturally (395). In short, the technology we are creating is going to allow us to speed up human evolution and enhance our species in ways that may have never have happened. Like the glowing mice, imagine that in humans. It is a possibility even though it is unlikely the majority of people would want to do that. 
        Along with advancing technology that has brought the possibility of genetically engineering humans to us, parents are another main reason why this concept exists. Parents want what is best for their kids. This includes things that will give the child more opportunities and chances to succeed in life like piano lessons, good schools, and private coaching. If parents are financially able to put their children in programs like this, they are likely to do so. Enhancing a child’s brain to make them smarter might be looked at similarly to these programs, as would genetically manipulating them to make them grow taller or stronger. Making them have traits that society considers beautiful would fall into this category too. Some parents would enhance their children to make them more likely to succeed in life if they were given the opportunity. Parents are already doing genetic testing to make sure their children do not have life altering diseases. A survey of nine hundred ninety nine people found that 75% of them supported genetic testing to counter mental retardation, 56% to counter blindness, and the majority to eliminate serious diseases(Naik). It is only a step further for things like athletic ability, which 10% supported. Intelligence was supported by 13%, and improved height was supported by 10%(Naik). If parents are willing to use genetic testing to choose which embryo they want to grow into a child, isn’t it only a step further to use genetic manipulation to enhance their children?
        One of the dangers of genetically engineering humans is that it may split society into a half that is genetically engineered and a half that is not. This would widen the gap between the financially sound and those unable to pay for things like this. Harry Reide, professor of religion at George Washington University commented on this concern when he said “there is already a natural impulse to segregate ourselves (...) this will accelerate that in a very dangerous direction (qtd. in Masci 428).” The divide between those who are genetically altered and those who are not would be far greater and much different than the divide between the rich and poor today. The rich who were genetically enhanced would not only have the money to help them succeed, they also would have more genetic capabilities. They would be given a head start on life that would not be able to be countered by hard work and perseverance. The poor would stay poor and the rich would keep getting richer. 
The entire human species could be altered and put at risk too. PGD opens the door for more technology to be developed and perfected, such as human germline engineering, which could lead changes in the human species. The genes altered in the baby during this process will be passed down to their offspring (Baird 14). “The possibilities for germline engineering go beyond the elimination of disease and open the door for modifications to human longevity, increased intelligence, increased muscle mass, and many other types of muscle enhancements (Baird 14).” Baird goes on to say that this “opens the door to the alteration of the human species (14).” This could be very problematic because different societies view different things as beautiful or valued, “there is no universally accepted ideal of biological perfection,” which would mean different societies would enhance different things on their children (Baird, 15). This could mean that unless the world came to an agreement on what was considered genes were considered good and which were considered bad, that different cultures could create different breeds of humans. This could be compared to dogs and how they were breed for different traits and now there are many different breeds within their species. Genetic enhancements may decrease human diversity too, which is very problematic both socially and biologically. Biologically, it could mean that the population would be more susceptible to a disease, making it easier to wipe out large amounts of people both through a natural epidemic or bioterrorism. Socially, it would take away the character and quirks of people. In the words of David Masci, it “would demean the uniqueness of each individual (427),” which is true. 
Humans would be dehumanized if they were genetically engineered because the parents of these children would look at them as if they were a product. Stephen L. Baird addresses this when he says “it will change the overriding purpose of IVF, from being a treatment for fertility to being able to pick and choose embryos like consumer goods- producing many, discarding most, and desiring only the chosen few (14).”  And the problem with this is that if parents view their children as consumer goods, they could become upset and displeased with their child if they are not exactly how they wanted them to be like. They would be dissatisfied with the product they purchased. We also do not know the physical long term effects of genetically engineering humans. The products of genetic engineering could lead dysfunctional and inhumane lives. Plus, there is no way to know if the child would have wanted to be genetically engineered. David Masci points out that “no one really knows whether altering a person’s genome would ultimately improve its life (428).” We also don’t know if the genetic enhancements would make someone happy. For example, children with down syndrome can be very happy, while some extremely smart people aren’t. So, we have no proof that making someone a little smarter will make them happier. Is it fair to do this to a person risking the chance that they would not want it? Or is it safer to just not tamper with their genetic makeup at all? It could also be too similar to acts such as forced sterilization and racial hygiene which have happened in the past which are now viewed as wrong and racist (Baird 16). Designer babies will be an easy way for society to show its genetic preferences. When arguing against the creation of designer humans, Stephen L. Baird says that the “techniques that could be used for designing babies will  give us dangerous new powers to express our genetic preference (16).” Those whose race is not prefered would be categorized as the other, and therefore be dehumanized. If allowed, designer babies could be viewed in the same way as forced sterilization and racial hygiene were. We could deeply regret it.
Whether it being intentional or not the children with manipulated genes could become aberrations. Some parents may want their child to have the same disability or disease that affects them. A survey done by Johns Hopkins found that three percent of preimplantation genetic diagnosis clinics offered parents the opportunity to do this by choosing the embryo with the same disease or disability, a “negative enhancement (Naik ""A Baby, Please. Blond, Freckles -- Hold the Colic"").” This is unfair to the child because they were predetermined to have a disadvantage throughout their life. The children may also suffer later in life due to side effects of gene manipulation. If techniques used for designer children are not properly perfected or if they go wrong, the child may suffer. When scientists have cloned less sophisticated organisms, they only succeed one to five percent of the time and the animals usually end up with various physical problems like defective kidneys and compromised immune systems (Masci 434). If scientists are not able to genetically manipulate less sophisticated organisms with no side effects, the problems that human children may end up with could be far more severe. Senior lecturer of the University of Wellington, Nicholas Agar, points out that we also need to be concerned because the insertion of one gene can interrupt the function of another, and that other gene could be crucial to survival (“Designer Babies: Ethical Considerations”). 
In order to avoid the problems posed by creating designer babies, we should avoid genetic manipulation all together unless for medical reasons. Society would not be able to govern and supervise what was happening because of genetic manipulation. Dov Fox, professor of bioethics at Yale with a PhD from Oxford, believes that we are “incapable of furnishing a coherent or desirable account to govern the way we use our emerging powers of biotechnology. Also, we do not know what we are getting into, we have not idea how much the natural lottery means to us (Fox 170).”
Eventually, if society decides it wants to start creating designer children, we should make sure they are well researched and well tested so that the babies created live normal and healthy lives. We do not want to create children who will suffer through their lives because of what happened to them before birth. If designer babies are not outlawed, for uses except medical reasons, then the next best thing is to make sure they are closely monitored and made with the confidence that they will lead healthy and normal lives. 
The time is coming for us to decide whether or not we want to start genetically engineering humans and what restrictions we should have on it. When we decide we need to keep in mind the possible consequences of changing our genetic makeup on not only the individual but also on society as a whole. Designer babies could split society and dehumanize children who are a product of it. We should not genetically manipulate people for nonmedical purposes."

Freedom and Remorse
        Many authors use the same literary tools to write their stories in a unique ways. This is the case for “The Cask of Amontillado” and “The Yellow Wallpaper.” These are two completely different stories that use the same literary tools.  In “The Cask of Amontillado” by Edgar Allen Poe and “The Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, both authors strategically use unreliable narrators and the denouement of their stories to send a message to their readers; however, Poe reveals that revenge cannot be taken with impunity while Gilman takes a bold stance against the patriarchal oppression women faced in the late nineteenth century, making their messages completely unrelated.   
        “The Cask of Amontillado” is a tale of revenge being told in first person participant by the protagonist, Montresor. Montresor is a proud and a jealous man, who lives by his family’s motto: “Nemo me impune lacessit,” (393) which is Latin for “no one attacks me with impunity.” In “The Cask of Amontillado,” Montresor is confessing to killing a man named Fortunato for revenge. However, throughout the story Montresor fails to reveal why he is taking revenge on Fortunato, other than that Fortunato has insulted him. All he says is “The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.” (390) Since the reason Montresor felt the need to take revenge on Fortunato is never explicitly said, it begs the question of what Fortunato did and if he actually deserved to be killed for it. His insult to Montresor may have been trivial and unintentional, which leaves readers to question the Montresor’s state of mind. The questionability of Montresor’s state of mind along with the mere fact that he is a murderer leads us to the conclusion that he is an unreliable narrator. The decision to use an unreliable narrator was very tactful on Poe’s part. Since Montresor is not trustworthy, readers can call into question what parts of the story he may be leaving out, and from there begin to examine why. The most obvious piece of the story to question is why Montresor is taking revenge, as stated above. The next absent pieces of the story to question are Montresor’s thoughts before and after he seals Fortunato into ancient catacombs and leaves him there to die. It would be interesting to see the contrast between the excitement and anticipated feelings Montresor feels prior to killing Fortunato compared to the wretchedness he feels after. In the end of the story, Montresor almost slips and tells his listener that he felt sick after killing Fortunato, but he catches himself and changes his words. “My heart grew sick - on account of the dampness of the catacombs.” (397) This hints that Montresor immediately regretted his decision to kill Fortunato, but was too proud to admit it. 
        The end and denouement of “The Cask of Amontillado” is where readers catch on to the message Poe is trying to give: that an avenger cannot take revenge without paying a price. Throughout the entire story, Montresor talks about punishing Fortunato with impunity. “I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.”(390) What this quote is saying is that a wrong is not avenged if the avenger is punished for taking revenge. Therefore Montresor must take revenge on Fortunato without any consequences for him to truly be avenged. Unfortunately for Montresor, after sealing Fortunato away in the catacombs, he begins to feel remorse. The remorse he feels for killing his friend means that his goal to punish with impunity was not fulfilled. And the sick feeling he felt after leaving Fortunato, demonstrates Poe’s message that revenge cannot be taken without consequence. In Montresor’s case, his consequence for avenging himself was a nauseating feeling of remorse. 
        Like “The Cask of Amontillado,” Charlotte Perkins Gilman uses an unreliable narrator in “The Yellow Wallpaper” to help her send a message to her readers. “The Yellow Wallpaper” is told in first person participant, just like “The Cask of Amontillado.” However, the “The Yellow Wallpaper is told through journal entries by the protagonist, Jane. Jane is unknowingly undergoing the rest cure to treat her postpartum depression. The rest cure is a treatment developed by Silas Weir Mitchel that was used mostly for women suffering from anorexia nervosa. The rest cure entailed isolation from friends and family for six to eight weeks; a fatty, milk based diet; bed rest; and no reading, writing, or sewing. Jane keeps a journal throughout her treatment process, against her husband’s wishes and knowledge. In her entries she describes her life at the colonial mansion she is temporarily living in. She notes that the bed is nailed down (157), and the windows have bars over them (153) without a second thought of the abnormality of that. This lets the reader know that she is oblivious to the situation she is in. She also is subjected to oppression by her husband, John. One time she speaks of how she believes that going into society would be good for her condition, which it most likely would have, but John doesn’t agree with her and so she puts that idea to rest. “I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus - but John says the very worst thing I can do is think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.” (152) Jane’s obliviousness to where she is and to John’s control over her is symbolic of women in the late nineteenth century who did not know that they were being held down by society and men. 
        Throughout her journals, Jane talks about the wallpaper in her room. At first she dislikes the wallpaper, but after a while she grows fond of it and begins to believe there is a woman trapped behind it. “The faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she wanted to get out.” (159) Jane becomes obsessed with finding the woman behind the wallpaper. Then Jane decides to help free the woman from the wallpaper. “That was clever, for really I wasn’t alone a bit! As soon as it was moonlight that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I got up to help her. I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we had peeled off yards of that paper.” (165) Eventually, Jane frees the woman from behind the wallpaper, and looses her mind. “‘I’ve got out at last,’ said I, ‘in spite of you and Jane! And I’ve pulled off most of the paper, so you can’t put me back!’” (167) Jane had become the woman behind the wallpaper, and had freed herself. The woman behind the wallpaper represents the women trapped in society, so by Jane freeing her, she has symbolically freed the ‘women of the late nineteenth century from the patriarchal oppression they were living under. By doing this, Gilman is essentially saying that a woman losing her mind was more favorable than a woman who would spend her life oppressed.  
In conclusion, both Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” and Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Cask of Amontillado” use the endings of their stories and unreliable narrators to shed light on larger problems. The issue Poe addresses is revenge and how it never comes without strings attached. Gilman, on the other hand, denounces the rest cure and criticizes the patriarchal society American women lived in during the nineteenth century."

Mansaf and the Sustainability of Traditional Jordanian Cuisine
        Living in the desert has proven time and time again to be unbelievably difficult for humankind. A lack of plants, animals, and water have forced those who live in such environments to learn to adapt to and conserve their resources. One desert dwelling group has shown themselves to be particularly adept at surviving in this type of environment; these people are the Bedouin, Mediterranean nomads. The Bedouin were primarily herders, and because of this they included a significant amount of dairy by products in their diets. Some were also agriculturalists who planted dates, olives, and almonds[1]. Stemming from their nomadic lifestyle and the scarce resources available to them, the majority of Bedouin cuisine consisted of grains and dairy by products, both having the ability to be dried and stored. Mansaf, a traditional Jordanian Bedouin feasting dish which has remained relevant and culturally significant through the test of time, showcases three main ingredients that perfectly encompass the needs and resources of traditional Bedouin people: lamb, bread, and jamid.[2] Grains used for making bread as well as jamid are able to be stored over long periods of time and then used during the dry season when other foods are scarce. Lamb used to be readily available to the Bedouin people of Jordan, as their nomadic lifestyle allowed them to constantly find suitable grazing land for the sheep. However, despite being sustainable and practical foods when nomadism was more prominent in Jordan, looking in to the production of these three ingredients now can shed light on to how much Jordan lacks sustainable agriculture and how dependent it is on other countries to provide them with foods that were previously both sustainable and resilient even in their arid climate.
Traditionally, Bedouin families kept herds of sheep, moving from place to place in search of the best grazing land to keep the sheep healthy. Today, however, the practice of nomadism and herding is almost decimate compared to how it used to be. On top of this, the population has increased significantly especially with an influx of more than six hundred sixty thousand United Nations registered Syrian refugees[3], putting increasing strains on Jordan’s food supply as the availability of water and other natural resources were scarce to begin with.  And although one of Jordan’s main agricultural products is still sheep[4], Jordan has had to import the majority of their supply of sheep meat. According to the United Nations Comtrade Database, in 2016 Jordan imported over one hundred million dollars worth of a combination sheep and goat meat whereas they only exported slightly more than four million dollars worth[5].  This only reconfirms the Central Intelligence Agency's assertion of how relient Jordan is on foreign assistance, and that Jordan’s regional supply of lamb meat is both insufficient and non resilient. 
        The second main ingredient of Mansaf is a bread called marquq, which is made primarily from wheat flour. Marquq serves as the base of the dish in overlapping pieces. Historically, the Bedouin were able to keep a constant supply of the grain needed to prepare this type of bread and other grain based products in their diet. Many everyday traditional meals were based on the mixture of grain and milk products, combining the dominant agricultural and pastoral elements of Bedouin society.[6] Wheat and other types of grains do not take much water to produce, and can be grown using water that has been stored from previous rainfalls. In addition to this grains can be stored for long periods of time, traditionally the Bedouin of Jordan would carry dried grain with them in sacks or store it in caves(milk and cereals). Today, however, Jordan is struggling to keep up with its demand for cereal food. Despite the Bedouin population applying techniques of sustainable desert agriculture throughout the last centuries, the combination of overgrazing, arid conditions, and other factors have caused this region to be one of the most degraded areas worldwide.[7] The cereal production in 2017 was estimated to be fifteen percent below the previous year. And even in years where the domestic production exceeds the average, Jordan still imports ninety seven percent of its cereal and feed. It is forecasted that in 2018 Jordan will import around nine hundred thousand tons of wheat, primarily from Romania, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine; and along with all this it has been estimated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that the increasing amount of Syrian refugees in Jordan will only further this strain on the wheat supply.[8]
        The third most important ingredient in Mansaf is a dairy product called jamid. Jamid is a made from yogurt which is defatted, salted, and dried to form almost a stone like substance. The Bedouin traditionally made this because it could be stored for long periods of time and provided a substantial amount of protein. In current times due to modern methods of refrigeration and the ability to import dairy there is really no more need to dried dairy products such as this except for the preparation of traditional dishes. 
        So, after taking a comprehensive look at the three main ingredients of Mansaf, ingredients that used to provide a reliable source of nutrition both in times of agricultural prosperity and famine, it becomes evident that Jordan does not have sufficient agricultural means of sustainment. It must be noted, however, that this is not a problem unique to their country. Both the Middle East and North Africa are forced to import about ninety percent of their food.[9] And as stated in Khalil Abu Rabia, Elaine Solowey, and Stefan Leu’s case study Environmental and Economic Potential of Bedouin Dryland Agriculture: The Middle East and the Mediterranean Basin, including Israel and the area analyzed in this paper are among the most severely degraded areas worldwide, with unsustainable, intensive agricultural exploitation beginning 10,000 years ago.

The Final Unveiling
Huda Shaarawi is regarded as one of the founders of the women’s rights movement in Egypt. She created the Egyptian Feminist Union, which aimed to provide girls and boys with equal opportunities to receive an education and reform laws surrounding the status of women, amongst other things. In addition to founding the Egyptian Feminist Union, which later came to be known as the Huda Shaarawi Association, and supporting similar groups, Shaarawi herself participated in bold demonstrations. Perhaps the most notable act of defiance was when she removed her veil at Cairo station in the Spring of 1923 upon returning from an international feminist movement in Rome (Badran 7). When she was older, Shaarawi chose to write about her life during the harem years. The memoirs she left have provided readers with a unique look into the private lives of women during this time. According to Margot Badran, the woman who translated Shaarawi’s memoirs from Arabic to English and introduced them in Harem Years: The Memoirs of an Egyptian Feminist, “private life, family life, inner feelings and thoughts were sacrosanct” and “were as veiled by convention as women’s faces had been” (1). Even with extensive research in this field, Badran was unable to find any other records of this kind. She views Shaarawi’s choice to record her life during the harem years as a “final unveiling” (1). There were many motivations behind Shaarawi’s decision to record her life and have them published, and some of the most prominent of these are her love for learning and her belief that “with learning, women could be equals to men if not surpass them;” the salons and lectures she either attended or put on; and the friends she surrounded herself with, most markedly Madame Rushdi (qtd. in Badron 42). 
When Huda was a young girl and had begun studying Arabic, she was having trouble reading the Koran without making mistakes. Her tutor, Shaikh Ibrahim, told her that this was because she did not know the rules of Arabic grammar. In response to this Shaarawi asked her tutor to teach her so he brought her a book on Arabic grammar the next day. When Said Agha, the eunuch who guarded Shaarawi at the time, saw this he responded by telling her tutor to take back the grammar as Shaarawi had no need for it since she would not “become a judge” (40). Shaarawi described this event vividly, as if the emotions from Said Agha’s response were still fresh. She revealed that at that moment she hated being a girl because she felt like it kept her from receiving the education she wanted and because it became a barrier between her and the freedom she sought. Writing gave Shaarawi a way to convey to her readers how serious both she and her female companions were about their education and it allowed her to create a case that women could be equal to men if given the same educational opportunities. (MORE CONTEXT OF HER LATER LIFE?) Huda Shaarawi’s passion and devotion to her studies was one of the main reasons she chose to record her life.
The lectures and salons she either put on or attended, also had a large influence in her decision to write memoirs. One of the first lectures Shaarawi attended was given by a woman named Marguerite Clement. Huda organized the lecture with the help of her husband and Princess Ain al-Hayat. It was a success. After the first lecture Huda asked Mlle Clement to give a series of lectures. Later, Egyptian women began to speak at them too. They discussed things such as social practices and compared the lives of western and oriental women. Even Prince Ahmad Fuad supported the lectures. It was during this time that Shaarawi began to realize that more than just a few people were open to discuss social customs regarding women in Egypt. 
Throughout her life, Shaarawi was in the presence of many strong willed and interesting women. Some she viewed as companions and others she viewed as mentors. One woman who had a massive impact on her was a Frenchwoman named Eugenie Le Brun, or Mme Rushdi. Shaarawi said that Mme Rushdi not only guarded her reputation, but also nourished her mind and spirit (78). Eventually, she was invited to attend Mme Rushdi's salons. At these salons women discussed issues such as veiling, offspring, and immorality. It was here that Huda discovered that some Europeans believed the veils the Egyptian women wore were meant to mask immorality. Mme Rushdi believed that the veils stood in the way of the advancement of Egyptian women. Mme Rushdi also planted the idea in Huda’s mind that writing was a way for people to remember her when she said “‘I have no children to perpetuate my memory, [...] but I shall remain alive through my books’”(80). These words drove Shaarawi to write about her life in her later years. Mme Rushdi’s view on veils may have influenced her choice to remove hers on that Spring day in 1923.
In conclusion, there were many factors that inspired Huda Shaarawi to write her memoirs with the intention of publishing them. However, her love for learning, the lectures and salons she attended, and her companionship with Mme Rushdi were the most influential in leading her to record her life. Huda Shaarawi’s memoirs are unique to their kind and have provided readers with a unique insight to harem life. Through her memoirs, Huda Shaarawi will continue to spread her ideas and values, even after her death."
America’s Lunch Line ,"Schapansky 1

America’s Lunch Line 
Imagine a group of kindergarteners, all of their stomachs rumbling, hungry and eager to 
get into the cafeteria to get their spot in the lunch line. Some kindergarteners might argue that 
since their classroom is geographically closer to the cafeteria they should have priority in getting 
to the front of the line. Others might believe that since they are hungrier they should have 
priority. The lunch lady does not intend to deny a child food; she just wants to ensure everyone 
waits for their proper turn in line. Each child understands this, but as all humans would, he still 
tries to move up a place in line. This poses a complex question: what constitutes a cut in line? If 
applied on a larger scale, specifically to the ever-expanding line that is the American 
Immigration system, what grants certain people special access to cut in front of those who are 
waiting their turn? Illegal immigration is a growing issue for those of all political persuasions; 
for the prospect of American prosperity - employment, education, and overall safety - is as 
enticing as ever before, compelling many to take extreme measures, like jumping in front of even 
those with prerequisites. The incentive to ""cut"" could be eliminated, however, by asking each 
individual to contribute to government-provided services - ensuring each and every immigrant 
their chance at the American dream. 
Today, as noted by the Migration Policy Institute, more than 11.4 million illegal aliens 
reside in the United States, who account for approximately 23.5% of all American-residing 
Schapansky 2 
immigrants (Zong). They are considered ‘illegal’ simply because they don’t pay the necessary 
fees, wait the allotted amount of time, or complete documentation required by the immigration 
process. Allowing select people to skip these pieces of the process is unfair to the people who are 
following the rules to enter the United States. According to George and Barbara Campos, who 
immigrated legally from Colombia and Argentina in their teenage years, “Our parents decided to 
start the paperwork two years before we came.” (Campos). Although undoubtedly, the journey to 
enter the United States illegally could be time-consuming, it most definitely does not exceed two 
years. Since there is little enforcement monitoring the process, skipping the wait instead of 
immigrating legally appeals to foreign citizens in hope of a better life. Similarly, when foreign 
citizens migrate illegally, they evade the fees associated with the migration process. In addition 
to, “Paying the government,”, George and Barbara had to, “Pay to travel here,” and prove their 
worthiness as an American taxpayer by, “[Having] $10,000 in the bank in 1964, [which is] quite 
a bit of money if we translate it to today’s dollars, [ $79,781.23] ” (Campos). By not only skipping 
the task of saving up money to travel to America but by not paying the government for potential 
citizenship and financial stability, illegal immigrants deem the legal migration process 
unnecessary and force legal migrants to make up for it by paying extra fees for 
government-provided services. Unquestionably, the lunch line can be long; nobody wants to 
wait. However, just because a child does not want to wait does not give them the privilege to cut 
the line. Each child who has their place in line altered because of someone else will feel upset 
and cheated. Regardless of the situation considered, cutting the line unnecessarily makes it unfair 
to those who are willing to pay and wait rightfully. 
Schapansky 3 
Really, when looking at the causes of illegal immigration, one might immediately point to 
a “lack of regulation” or “dulcet consequences”, as mentioned by the Center of Immigration 
Studies in their article regarding the true meaning of migration (22). Immigrants might be 
persuaded to immigrate illegally, as the consequences are not as intimidating as they are made 
out to be. Undoubtedly, these two factors weigh heavily on the issue of illegal immigration, but, 
in my opinion, the real issue is that some immigrants believe that their need for the “American 
Dream” is so much more feasible and worthy of recognition than others, which gives them a 
reasonable excuse to cut in line. We, as humans, tend to worry about ourselves before others. It’s 
human condition. Our tendency to care about ourselves and those in our family overpowers our 
desire to consider the thoughts and feelings of others. Because of this reason, it is easy for a 
migrant to want to bring their family into the safety of America before they really take the time 
to understand how many other families they are harming by doing so. In terms of the cafeteria, 
what makes a child bold enough to move forward in the line? They could think to themselves 
that because their classroom is closer, they should be able to stand in front of the other 
kindergarteners who have to walk a few feet farther. When children decrease their wait unfairly, 
they disregard the feelings of the other hungry students. All in all, foreigners love the idea of the 
American Dream, and would rather protect their family by migrating illegally than wait for legal 
processing and consider the circumstances of other families. 
Even before the United States was a country itself, it was known to immigrants, such as 
Smithsonian’s Barbara Binkowski, as, “ a land of opportunity where you can change your 
circumstances and that you can be able to better your financial, social, economic, cultural 
well-being in the process.”. Later in her research concerning the reasons immigrants come to 
Schapansky 4 
America, she notes that this promise is written on the Statue of Liberty and in our founding 
documents as a democracy (Binkowski). Without a doubt, this life sounds enticing. However, 
some migrants are more desperate than others for such a promise and try to prove their worth by 
obtaining it quickly, rather than waiting their turn and making it fair for everybody involved. 
Inevitably, others might believe that migrating illegally is the result of a dangerous 
situation in one’s home country. The circumstances are too dangerous and waiting for processing 
is not the safest option. However, even in said situations, immigration processes were created to 
transfer people legally and efficiently (Waldmann). For example, in a country such as Colombia, 
where sexual violence and terrorist threats still run rampant, citizens are still able to complete 
documentation in a lawful and timely way in order to emigrate to the States (Waldmann). The 
American Immigration system was created in order to assist foreigners in escaping their old 
lives, which unquestionably could include danger. 
The consequences of skipping the line may not be immediately obvious. Most commonly, 
the consequences of being caught for migrating illegally include, as put by psychologist and 
author Victoria Esses, “detainment and deportation,” (134). However, beyond these physical 
consequences, each immigrant sacrifices the wholeness of the American promise. Because 
immigrants live their new lives in fear of being caught and/or separated from their families, they 
engage themselves less with the environment around them. By migrating illegally, immigrants 
limit themselves from the full potential they could achieve as a new American citizen. Living in 
fear restricts each individual from pursuing the American Dream in its entirety because they 
choose to pursue lower-paying jobs and less noticeable life paths, in order to draw as little 
attention to themselves as possible (Esses 136). Of the large influx of illegal immigrants in the 
Schapansky 5 
past few years, who account for an astounding 3.8% of the entire American population, many 
spend their days in the produce fields, which frequently pay below minimum wage (Center of 
Immigration Studies 7, Esses 135). Throughout her entire work, Esses explains how immigrants 
plan their entire journey based upon the fact that they are doing so illegally, and concludes by 
saying that each immigrant should analyze what parts of the American Dream they are willing to 
give up (133-137). So, it could be determined that the consequence of migrating illegally is 
living in a constant state of fear, which regulates the involvement that each alien holds in their 
new home. Anecdotally, kindergarteners who have skipped the line are so afraid to be noticed by 
the lunch lady that they will purchase less food in order to be as inconspicuous as possible. In 
order to protect the children who have waited for their rightful turn, the lunch lady will move 
those who have jumped in the queues to the end of the line. Luckily for the children, their 
physical consequences don’t come anywhere near those of illegal immigration. 
At the same time, as immigrants have been entering America illegally, legal citizens have 
developed a stigma around the idea of an ‘illegal alien’. Some will go as far as to presume that 
out of the near 12 million aliens, no single person provides any measurable value to the United 
States as a whole (Zong). Despite the value that each immigrant brings, the lack of legal 
documentation degrades the picture that legal citizens see. If the goal of coming to America is to 
be accepted by a new, inviting community, illegal immigration assists in doing just the opposite. 
Some Americans aren’t willing to share opportunity with aliens simply because of their illegal 
status; therefore, aliens are overlooking any possibilities that would be provided. By migrating 
illegally, each alien accepts the blame from each angry American citizen and therefore sacrifices 
Schapansky 6 
the acceptance and any opportunities that would be provided from them, just as they do the 
American dream. 
Some say, for instance, that because of the large scale of the issue, finding a solution is 
impossible. Due to the 12 million immigrants already hiding in the states, it would not be worth 
trying to find each and every one of them and ask them to leave or complete the migration 
process (Zong). However, creating equality for each of the immigrants, residing both legally and 
illegally, isn’t as difficult as it appears. 
Instead of trying to deport each of the immigrants, a more feasible idea would be to 
require that each family pay their fair share in government taxes, regardless of their legal or 
illegal status. For all to share in the prosperity, we should all share in the responsibility as well. 
By asking each individual to contribute to the government services, many of which are already 
used in supporting illegal aliens, the playing field is evened for all immigrants, whether they are 
residing in the states legally or not (Griffin 373). For example, if there was an open field 
discovered, any and all individuals could come and share in the prosperity of the field. Over 
time, the community at the field may establish joint resources like restrooms, drinking fountains, 
and scheduled sports. With this community effort, there are no additional benefits, solely 
additional costs and responsibilities. Although it would be great to be able to allow all 
newcomers to enjoy the existing services, it isn’t practical to put all of the expenses of the 
services on the existing community. Although there was a time when entering the field was open 
and free, the landscape has changed and now there is a community responsibility to retain the 
benefits shared by all. Similarly, in the United States, there was a time when there were no 
community services. Now that the services are established, including educational, medical, and 
Schapansky 7 
recreational options, it is fair and equitable that all individuals that share in prosperity also share 
in the responsibility (Griffin 374). Current citizens of the United States support the shared 
services in a multitude of ways. Through taxes, insurance, and other means, each individual is 
contributing to the common welfare of others. To offer the same services to everyone without 
having everyone contribute will eventually deplete the services shared. It does make sense to 
care for those in need, but there needs to be a accountability on both ends and a collective desire 
to participate in the established governing rules and regulations. Not only is this fair for the 
current community of both American citizens and legal immigrants, but it provides sustainability 
so that future generations may also reap the benefits of a society that has established services 
consumed by the community. Because it would be incredibly difficult to curb the immigration 
numbers, asking the current illegal aliens to pay their dues will make it fair for each of the 
immigrants who are already participating in the American economic system. Certainly, 
everybody would benefit if each country offered prosperity and safety, just as America does, but 
in to respect for drive for the American Dream, each immigrant should support the economy to 
create equality for each individual. 
Just like kindergarteners in the lunch line, migrants must wait for their rightful turn to 
enter America. Regardless of what lies at the beginning of the line, or whatever one might think 
will grant them permission to skip the line, working legally is always the route to take because 
there are undoubtedly other people who have it worse. Immigrants might be more in need of a 
change to a stable lifestyle, or kindergarteners might be hungrier, but it is only fair for everyone 
to wait and pay their dues. Without doing so, they will have to face the consequences, whether it 
be as mild as a boot to the end of the line, or as extreme as a separation of family from one 
Schapansky 8 
country to another. Simply put, following the rules for any process makes life easier for all. 
However, as it might be difficult to rid each state of its share of illegal immigrants, each 
immigrant could start contributing to government and tax-funded services to achieve the same 
level of equality. If illegal immigrants were willing to do so, we Americans, as a country, would 
experience overall fairness and an increased desire to share the promise of American opportunity 
with every individual who would like to enter our country.

More Than Surface Value: A Dialogue
This scene takes place at a prestigious art museum in Spain full of art from all different ages and styles. A potential buyer and a group of onlookers are admiring Goya’s Mariana Waldstein, Marquessa of Santa Cruz (1797) and J.-A.-D. Ingres’ Madame Moitessier (1851). GOYA approaches group from behind and begins speaking to BUYER. 
GOYA: Buenas tardes amigos! Isn’t she absolutely ravishing? 

BUYER: *back still facing GOYA and looking at the paintings* Oh, she is! That’s why I’m buying this artwork!


GOYA: Oh, mi amor, I wasn’t speaking about the painting. 


BUYER: *turns around shocked but then sees GOYA and smiles* My dear Goya! How good it is to see you, for it has been much too long. You’re as cheeky as ever I see. 


GOYA: Only for you my darling. But, speaking of beautiful works of art, you’re here to purchase my lovely Mariana Waldstein, Marquessa of Santa Cruz, correct?


BUYER: Oh, dear. Now this a bit uncomfortable. I know that I wrote to you a month ago about purchasing your painting; however, when I got here today, I saw Ingres’ exquisit Madame Moitessier right next to your Mariana and, unfortunately for you, I have changed my mind and will no longer be buying your Mariana Waldstein, Marquessa of Santa Cruz. 


GOYA: My love, what made you change your mind? I thought that you were enamored with Romanticism artwork? Neoclassicism is such a different style. It’s like comparing apples and oranges. How did you make such a drastic change?


BUYER: Well, let’s start with the composition. Madame Moitessier is so beautifully posed in the center of the painting and is the only form in the painting; therefore, rendering her the undisputed focal point. The details are so complex and masterfully executed, for example, the lace pattern in her dress is mirrored on the wall which gives the painting a sense of fluidity. Ingres, quite skillfully, painted her like a history painting from the academy. The space is so shallow to the point where she is IN the picture plane. Her body is strong and her pale skin draws your eye directly to her face where she meets and holds your stare. Her exposed shoulders and face make a nice triangle in the middle of the painting which is outlined by her dark hair and black dress. The fan in her hand, her arm, the curvature of the flowers in her hair, and the pearl necklace all draw your attention back to her face, which is what Ingres wants. 


GOYA: I see what you mean; however, I am going to have to disagree. First off, in my painting, the space is also quite shallow, but Mariana Waldstein, Marquessa of Santa Cruz is just close enough to the picture plane where she seems to be beckoning the viewer to step into the painting. You can feel her presence whereas Madame Moitessier is IN the picture plane because that’s what she is; a picture. The minute details in Ingres’ painting, while beautifully executed and a fine expression of his academic training, make it seem as if Madame Moitessier is just another one of the objects. She is staged inside with ornate jewelry, wooden cabinets, and intricate patterns drawing your attention to other things meanwhile, in my painting, I placed Mariana Waldstein, Marquessa of Santa Cruz outside to give the painting a sense of freedom. Even with this freedom, Mariana is, as you said, “the undisputed focal point.” 


BUYER: I did say that; however, what about the house, the fan and the bow? Are they not “minute” and “ornate” as well? 


GOYA: The details in the painting such as the farm house in the background and the fan in her hand are present however, they don’t distract from Mariana. Even the large pink bow grabs your eye but directs you back to her face, where she lovingly and coyly holds your stare. I painted the clouds behind her in an optically pleasing triangular shape that outlines the body of Mariana and gives her a deity-like glow which makes her importance more known. Additionally, even though she is in the forefront of the painting, the distance between Mariana and the farm house is ambiguous and it seems as if Mariana is painted largely out of scale in comparison; however, this was done to make her importance even more evident to the viewer. When speaking of composition, I wanted to focus on Mariana and make her my composition instead of focusing on other details. 


BUYER: Wow, you make very good points, Goya. But I still am not convinced your painting is superior, especially in relation with the paint application and the technique in which you executed your painting. For example, in Ingres’ painting, there is no sign of lumpy paint nor brush strokes. Madame Moitessier’s skin is flawless and smooth, the lace in her dress is beautifully intricate and the crosshatching makes it seem as if Ingres just glued a piece of lace on top of his painting. The shadows are masterfully placed, even under the pearl necklace. They follow the strong and defined lines of her body and make it seem as if there is a light directly hitting her, making her skin glow. Ingres painted her body in the center of the frame and placed a wooden cabinet and a couch to her sides which create two triangles from the top of the painting down both sides of her body. This exhibits Ingres skill with proportions and spacing, making the painting more aesthetically pleasing. Ingres left no surface untouched and his brush strokes are almost undetectable unless you put your nose to the painting. His extreme attention to detail really emphasizes how valuable this painting is to him. Madame Moitessier is truly a work of art. 


GOYA: I am in no way disrespecting Ingres and his style, in fact, I truly do admire his skill and his ability to add such small details to every inch of his paintings. However, the Neoclassical style and academic regimen through which Ingres paints, gives no room for movement nor emotion. The wooden cabinet and the couch next to Madame Moitessier’s body, while creating optically pleasing triangles, also confine Madame Moitessier to the room and to the specific spot in which she is standing. Additionally she is painted within a room, which just feeds into the stereotype that women can’t leave their homes. In contrast, as I have stated earlier, I painted Mariana Waldstein, Marquessa of Santa Cruz outside in nature to give the viewer a sense of freedom. Mariana is far from the farm house in the background and is free to go where she pleases. She the only form in the forefront of the painting and there isn’t anything blocking her from moving around the plane. The strong and harsh lines of the Neoclassical style make Madame Moitessier appear statuesque and add to the staticness of the painting whereas the softer and slightly fuzzy lines of my painting make it much more kinetic. The soft lines make it seem as if Mariana’s dress is flowing in the wind and the fuzziness outlining her body make the viewer focus on Mariana as if she could disappear at any moment. Mariana appears wholly present and unpresent at the same time which just draws us in a viewers even more.


BUYER: I see where you are coming from, but how do we know that Mariana is truly “free” and Madame Moitessier is “confined”? 


GOYA: It’s all in the body language. Madame Moitessier, while she is facing us, has body language that is deterring us. Her shoulders are slightly angled away from the viewer making her seem uninterested in us. Additionally, her arms are doing different things which gives us a sense that she is uncomfortable. One hand is clasping her necklace, indicating a nervous tick, one arm is covering her abdomen, closing her off from us as viewers, and her other arm is dangling slightly bent as if she wants to cross it with the other but is unable to. Her uncomfortableness causes a separation between her and us as viewers. She is looking at us but not directly as her glance is slightly up and to our left. She is disinterested in us as viewers and seems emotionally detached from her situation. 
Inversely, the body language of Mariana Waldstein, Marquessa of Santa Cruz, while at first seems closed, is actually very welcoming and intriguing. We originally think that she might be disinterested in us because her arms are crossed, but her shoulders and chest open towards us, beckoning us to step into the painting and follow her. She has this “Come hither” look in her eyes and we can’t help but be intrigued by her cheeky smirk. We want to know what she is thinking, where she’s going, and if she wants us to follow her. There is this appealing mystery in her glance, stance, dress, and soft lines that suggest movement as if she could just disappear in an instant. Even her feet are facing towards us which is an indicator that we are important to her. Also, just the fact that we can SEE her feet is a huge teller that Mariana is free in comparison to Madame Moitessier. Ingres cropped his painting so that Madame doesn’t have any visible legs. This emphasizes the fact that she is confined to her home and doesn’t even have legs to leave if she wanted. 


BUYER: I never realized that body language was so important to the feeling expressed through a painting. But I am still just so enamored with the colors and the jewelry in Ingres’ painting. Goya, my dear, look at how rich that purple is, how the teal in the chair jumps out at you and compliments the jewel on Madame Moitessier’s wrist. And oh, how lovely the pink flowers are. And that black dress. Wow. It’s black but still has so much depth to it. Especially adorned with the red broach that blends the purple walls with the pink flowers. And the gold details on the fan and her rings are just incomparable. 


GOYA: My love, I whole heartedly agree that Madame Moitessier’s adornments are a beautiful example of Ingres skill and that the colors are rich; however, I can’t help but find it a little over the top. Madame Moitessier is showcasing everything that she owns: roses, gold, silver, jewels, silk, lace, pearls, intricate woodwork, etc but by doing that, she seems to be objectifing herself. She is defined by her belongings and trying to be “royal” as the purple wall insinuates, but by idealizing her body and being painted like a poreciln doll, she is dehumanizing herself. This painting makes us feel as if we should admire her and aspire to be her instead of wanting to step into the painting and join her. Conversely, I painted Mariana Waldstein, Marquessa of Santa Cruz with subtle adornments that don’t distract from her as a person. She isn’t covered in much flashy jewelry but you can tell that she’s important and has money from the subtle details. She’s dressed in lace, which is a highly expensive material. She too has a fan, although it’s not too gaudy. She is weaing silver heeled shoes that show her wealth. She wearing ambiguous jewelry on her arms that doesn’t distract from her face. On the top of her head, there is a pink bow made of silk wich is a highly desirable material. All these subtle details insinuate her wealth instead of making it her defining characteristic. This makes her realistic, personable, and tasteful, just like you, my love.  


BUYER: Okay, but still, the colors of your painting are just so much more faded than Ingres’. 


GOYA: I wouldn’t call it faded, but instead, realistic. All my colors are dynamic and exemplify the possibility of movement and change whereas in Ingres painting, the colors are dark, one dimensional and don’t necessarily blend into the next. The reason that my colors look “faded” is because I painted Mariana with the idea that she is outside in natural light compared to Madame Moitessier who is painted inside under a theatrical light. The shadows in my painting give it depth and realism. The white undertones lighten the painting and help the flow of the colors. The pink bow highlights the pink in her cheeks, her lips, and her arms, and additionally blends well with the pink undertones in the mountains and the sky. This color gives the painting a sense of life and youthfulness that is absent in the static and dark colors of Ingres painting. 


BUYER: My dear Goya, I know you have been presenting such good points and I know I promised to buy your work but--


GOYA: --Mi amor, I am so sorry to interrupt, but please let me say one last thing before you make up your mind. 


BUYER: Goya...I don’t know. I--


GOYA: Please? Just one thing. I promise. 


BUYER: Alright, go ahead. 


GOYA: Thank you. I want to speak and just tell you why YOU should buy my painting. As I said before, Mariana’s body language and facial expressions hold your interest, intrigue you, pull you in and make you think. There is so much more than the face value to this painting, and for as long as I have known you mi amor, I know that you too are so much more than what meets the eye. You, mi amor, like Mariana are a free woman who isn’t defined to a home. You are forward thinking, you are a strong and you don’t need jewelry to prove your worth. You intrigue people, you deserve to be looked at as the woman you are not just an idealized stereotype of a woman. You require time to truly understand what your meaning and intentions are. Your have rosy cheeks that are so full of youthful life and movement. You are more than a novel object in a painting. You are a valued and free woman who has legs to carry you anywhere you want to go and the freedom to do so. 


BUYER: Goya, I--


GOYA: --So I say to you, amor, buy something that represents and reflects who you are. Be successful but humble, be more than material objects, be different, embrace your emotions and be yourself. 


BUYER: You are as skilled with your words as you are with a paintbrush. Here. *hands GOYA an envelope with money* And keep anything extra. Anyone with this much passion for their art deserves to be compensated for it. 


GOYA: Thank you, my love. May my painting adorn your home for years and years to come."

The Narratives of a Universal Enemy
	As the world experiences the consequences of globalization, western views of Islamic fundamentalism and stigmatized stereotypes of the Middle East manifest narratives depicting the Middle East as anti-modern and aggressive, begetting schisms in communities. Reflecting on Mahmood Mamdani’s excerpt, western media creates the idea that Muslim culture stagnated in the seventh century and fundamentalist adopt violent spiritual paths, resulting in a misconception that the Muslim World is inheritably anti-modern with the motivation to desecrate other cultures (Mamdani 18-20).  The misconception adopts the conviction that political views derive from religious practices, creating that division of the “good vs bad Muslim” where the bad has hijacked the good’s genuine faith (Mamdani 24). Mark Jurgensmeyer highlights the process the “bad Muslim” emanates as rejection of secular ideas, erase established liberal boundaries, and rebuking compromises the liberalized religion enjoined (Jurgensmeyer 300). The followers of the new fundamental sect surmise that a crisis of legitimacy has plagued their faith and wage a cosmic war to create a legitimate a faith, demonizing their enemy (ibid 300). Groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban adopt terrorism to civilize and attract attention, proving to the West that Islam is anti-modern and pugnacious.  Mamdani rationalizes that the West’s views are fettered to narratives created during the Catholic Crusades and reinforced in the Battle of Vienna in 1683, demonizing the Islamic world as infidels and Satanic (MM 24).  However,  Mamdani reasons that people must shift the focus from the decades of Taliban terror to encompass a larger understanding of Islam and history.  Madeleine Bunting’s “Can Islam Liberate Women” illustrates a narrative of traditional Islam that counters the notion that traditional Islam equates fundamental extremism. For Muslim women traditional Islam liberates and provides an opportunity to disprove Western misconceptions of their faith. Wearing a hijab follows a traditional view of Islam that encourages education and projects women and men as equals, protecting each other’s well-being (Bunting 572). Islam claims parallels western feminism as the religion’s roots are deeply imbedded in equality; God referred to neither a man nor a woman; Mohammed’s wives became the original prophets of the religion; emphasis placed to honor one’s mother (397).  To many western feminists the hijab symbolizes oppression, and a repression of identity. However to the Muslim woman the hijab represents an opportunity to control their sexuality, according to Islam’s value that sex is for love and not power as represented in Western culture (Bunting 573).  In the film “Where Do We Go Now”, the women of village invite Russian ecdysiasts to distract the men from erupting in violence. The stark difference between the invited women’s and the village women’s dressing presents the idea of empowerment though modesty. The village women force the men to pursue interest on an emotional and intellectual level rather than a purely sexual motivation. Traditional Islam is often interpreted and squeezed to fit a narrative, matching the misconception Islam is evil.
	Following the attacks in Quebec City, the terrorist attack at the Pittsburgh synagogue, and the Overland Park shooting, the Christchurch terrorist attack on March 15th highlighted the palpable dangers of stigmatizing and othering any cultural group. Educating new generations to accept and not just tolerate other cultures and provide opportunity for multicultural communities form the foundation for co-existence. Martin Luther King Jr. stated “We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent coannihilation”. Love is a choice not to dominate and the will to help others to find themselves. rum

Messel and the Evolving Berlin Apartment 
	Since the mid nineteenth century, the barrack style Mietskaserne plagued Berlin tenants with cramped living conditions that created unhealthy and blatantly inhumane situations. Berlin’s urban planning codes, the Hobrecht Plan, allowed these complexes to be developed because of its loose regulations, regarding transportation regulations and not building construction. However, an Architect named began designing apartment complexes that focused on human dignity and easing the burdens of daily life. Analyzing the apartments buildings on Sickeningstrasse and Proskauer Strasse, Messel’s work assisted the working class to live an improved life with public facilities, low density apartment complexes, conveniently located stores on the ground floor, large courtyards with greenery, communal facilities for children and education, ventilation improvement, and bountiful natural light.
	Understanding the history and creator of the Hobrecht Plan is essential to creation of the Mietsarne that Alfred Messel envisioned to eradicate. Created in 1862, the Hobercht Plan regulates Berlin’s urban development, allowing for growth and movement, especially the needs of industry and transportation, but ignored substantial needs for aesthetic guidelines and basic conditions. Prior to the infamous housing plan, James Hobrecht had eleven years of practical training and passed two certifications. Two years later, the berlin police president entrusted him with designing the new Berlin street plan to blend together the various neighborhoods. Since urban planning was a not formal science, the plan was a “compendium of local police regulations determining which lots were to be developed with buildings on the outskirts of the city, and which lots were to be classified as public streets and squares and thus left undeveloped”1. The Housing plan had two major objections: creating large housing blocks and “orbital roads that connected radial roads”2. Hobercht envisioned these large housing blocks to be accompanied by large green spaces, serving as restful and quite squares for inhabitants. Often these green spaces were meant to be in wide streets, serving as a median in the road that pedestrians could stroll through3. However, financing these green spaces proved difficult often relying on the wealth to fund and maintain the spaces. Critics of the spaces claimed the strips of gardens “threatened to restrict the flow of traffic”4.  These green squares were never enacted upon. Critics attribute the first objection for the Mietskarne that plagued Berlins housing for decades. 
	While the Hobrecht plan did not inherently demand, that buildings be built in barrack housing style, architects exploited the large plots of land to build the Mietskarne.  The Mietskarne followed similar structural styles, composing of five story front houses, side wings, and cross houses that enclosed courtyards of varying widths5. While architectures built the buildings for various social classes, the design plans all followed this basic design. Critics describe the barrack style housing as “herds of people have been packed on top of each other”6, creating insalubrious and comfortable conditions for the tenants. Without the proper regulations, the architects and land owners exploited the poor and working classes to maximize profits, corralling the inhabitants into cramped conditions with limited natural lighting and in back parts of the buildings7. During the 1860’s and 1870’s, there was not yet a created style or solution to replace the Mietskarne, allowing the design to afflict the over four million people8 that inhabited these buildings. Another Berlin housing code that contributed, was the Building Code of 1853 that established vague and unrestrictive guidelines. The only building restrictions were that the height of the eaves could not exceed seventy feet and the courtyard had to be a minimum of seventeen by seventeen feet (the diameter a firetruck needed to turn)9. The Building Code of 1853 did not exempt architects from designing rooms without windows, proper ventilation, rules dictating façade designs, and cramped living quarters10.  For these reasons, Alfred Messel desired to undo the wrong doings on the Berlin people at the hands of the previous architects.
	 A proper introduction to Messel’s life and career manifests Messel’s desire to improve and revolutionize housing in Berlin. Messel was born in 1853 in Darmstadt and studied in Berlin. In 1873, he entered the Kunstakademie in Kassel with his friend Ludwig Hoffmann, and in the next year they both began a four-year term at the Berlin Bauakademie11. Beginning in 1878 and ending his tenure in 1887, Messel worked for the Prussian state government and designed housing, offices, and department stores12. In 1886 Messel established a professional practice and erected numerous large apartment blocks in Berlin, noteworthy for their large courtyards.13 While constructing his private complexes, he designed his buildings in mind “for town houses and informality and vernacular forms for country or suburban residences”.14 His most famous project was the 1896 Wertheim department store that revolutionized department store construction. Messel’s earliest housing project conformed to the Mietkarne, excluding a courtyard that was “unusually large… and containing greenery”15. In 1892, Messel became a board member and architect of the Berliner Building and Savings Association, constructing several housing complexes that demonstrated a transition from the Mietskaserne16. In the last decade of his career, Messel’s usual Baroque references transitioned into the German Neo-classical style.17   Tragically, Messel passed away in 1909, ending his chance of fully revolutionizing the housing movement.
	In Messel’s first housing project in 1893 located on Sickingenstrasse in Wedding, following the Mietskaserne layout, but possessed a larger courtyard than the mandated seventeen by seventeen feet. The layout consisted of the traditional front house, covering two lots with twin front houses, two side wings surrounding a courtyard. Differences between the Mietskarne and Messel’s apartments originated in the floor design of the apartments. The ninety apartments consisted of two room, one and half room, and one room apartments, measuring respectively 490 square feet, 380 square feet, and 330 square18.  This differed from the usual Mietskarne ten to twelve apartments with 12 rooms. The difference room quantity and size contributed to several health improvements. Dividing the apartments into smaller units alleviated overcrowding and close engagements with the other tenants. In the Mietskarne, apartments consisted of multiple families, cramming entire families into one or two rooms. In the apartments, families operated workshops, manufacturing clothing, carpentry, and tapestry, and in these rooms, sick tenants with diseases, ranging from tuberculous to typhoid, attempted to heal in crude isolation areas. In addition to the cramped living areas, architects failed to design rooms with proper ventilation or natural lighting, creating stale air, mold, and foul smells. When the architects erected the buildings with the small courtyards, the inner apartment rooms received minimal natural lighting, forming miserable conditions.  The Berlin housing Codes of 1853 and the Hobrecht plan created these wretched conditions because the codes did not regulate the internal conditions of the buildings. Architects and landowners exploited the poor, maximizing their profits by constructing the building to maximum lot and code limits, and forced the families into dire circumstances19.   Messel’s apartments did not have the large multi-room apartments but divided the apartments into single or double room apartments to mitigate these problems. Single families inhabited the apartments that each had its own water closet and kitchen with a vent above the pantry20. The ventilation and individual water closets created significantly more sanitary than the Mietkarsne, allowing fresh air to flow into every apartment and impeding toxic mold. The Sickingenstrasse complex possessed more than the improvement upon basic human health conditions.

Wohnanlage Sickingenstraße 7 & 8 (Berlin.de, Landesdenkmalamt Berlin)21
	In Messel’s floor plan of the Sickingenstrasse complex, the complex’s density is significantly lower than Mietkaserne complexes with similar lot sizes. Messel designed these buildings to be “subservient to dignity”22 so that the inhabitants escaped the deplorable conditions of the Mietskaserne. The Sickingenstrasse complex lot measures 19,355 square feet but the complex construction is only on 8,600 square feet23. Embodying the difference in square footage gap, the courtyard became an essential element in Messel’s reform complexes. This courtyard exceeded the minimum courtyard specifications, allowing a plethora of health and living benefits. In the Mietskaserne, the internal small courtyards regulated little natural sunlight to penetrate the internal rooms facing the courtyard, begetting dismal living conditions.  Designing the large courtyards, Messel allowed sunlight to engulf the courtyard and allowed sunlight to permeate the internal rooms of the apartments, improving living conditions by allowing ventilation and natural light24. Natural light boasts multiple health benefits, albeit the psychological and medical discoveries procured prior to Messel. In a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (USA), natural lighting is proven to be “effective in reducing stress, decreasing anxiety, holding attention, and improving mood”25. Denoting these health improvements, natural light improves health and motivation for people, eliminating the effects of the poor lighting of the Mietskerne, and contributes to work place productivity. Additional to the sunlight, the courtyard held large gardens and leafy foliage for the tenants to enjoy. Tenants relaxed inside the gardens that mimicked the countryside, escaping from the bustling and growing streets of Berlin. Courtyards provided safe locations for children to gambol and play within the vicinity of their homes. The floor plans demonstrated an additional transformation, benefiting the Berlin workers. In the front houses, Messel created deliberate floor plans that mirrored baroque era floor plans. The front house floor plans depict living rooms overlooking the street and the bedrooms and kitchen facing the courtyards, which differed from the Mietskarsne26. Mietskarsne rooms lined a long corridor, not following the contemporary cluster formation of the rooms, and received little ventilation and natural lighting27. The baroque style layout permitted sunlight to fill every room and provide proper ventilation.  This style of apartment greatly appealed to the working classes.
	Regarding façade design, the Hobrecht Plan and the Building Codes of 1853 did not regulate façade and visage imaging, allowing Messel to create an identity for the building.  In the image of Sickingenstrasse 7 & 8, Messel created several features that were functional and aesthetic. Attempting to create a distinctly Germanic style, Messel employed a “vast roof, generally of pantiles, and lit with flat lucarne dormers…”28.  These roofs greatly differed from English country home sweeping style of roofing, mirroring a practical quazi-Rennisance roof.  To separate from a bourgeois style hierarchal style façade, Messel designed a lively, cross-story structure, expressing various details and styles. Reviewing the building, Messel divided the complex into two symmetrical facades with a distinct dividing wall. The entrance to the apartments features a roman order columned portals with spherical finials on top of the façade29. On both sides of the portals are stone arcades that cover the entrance of stores. Messel deliberately designed the ground floor to have stores to provide tenants with nearby resources such as grocers, hardware stores, clothing stores, and local municipality. The practicality of the lower level stores immensely improved tenants’ quality of life and influenced future architects after Messel’s death. Another impressive and distinctive feature of the complex are the balconies. The balconies span across the entire floor on the second and fourth. On the first and third floors, the balconies have gaps between rooms and assumed stairwells. These balconies reach out from the buildings over the sidewalk below, creating the image of the building coming forward. Possessing intricate and ornamental iron bars, the balconies seem light and nearly floating in the air.30  Messel designed the roof of the building to have large gables on the far sides with wooden motifs inside the smaller of the gables. The gables and motifs create a strong Germanic character that Messel strove to recreate in the apartment complex31. With half-hipped roof on the larger gables, Messel portrayed a popular feature in German country house in the design of the building32.  In the original construction of the building, the roof had lucarne dormers that were subsequently removed in a renovation during its hundred-twenty-five-year existence. Pantiles lining the top of the roof emphasizes the Germanic nature of the building, separating it from Parisian and Anglo styles33. When designing the building, Messel strove to define and create Germanic attributes and ultimately succeeded. 

Wohnanlage Proskauer Straße (Berlin.de, Landesdenkmalamt Berlin)34

	After the construction of the Sickingenstrasse apartments, Messel designed the Proskauer Strasse, 14 -17, and the Schreinerstrase 63 & 64 apartment complex in 1897.  The complex was five stories high with a distinctive U-shaped structure, omitting the usual additional rear front house, with 116 apartments and shops located at the street level35. Messel rejected constructing cross houses and side wings that would have increased the quantity of apartments but diminished the quality of living, conflicting Messel’s desire to reduce building density. The property measures 32,580 square feet but the construction only covers 1,340 feet36.   Low building density eliminated the health problems caused by the dense Mietskaserne construction and allowed for open space to be converted into gardens and play area for children.  Messel constructed the apartments to have more square footage than the Sickingenstrasse apartments. The single room apartments measured 340 or 410 square feet; one and half room apartments measured 490 square feet; 2 room apartments measured 620 or 720 square feet.37  The smaller apartments appealed to the working class, allowing single families to live in the apartments, and adopted by future architects for workers’ housing projects. These apartments followed Messel’s previous layout with the living room overlooking the street, and the kitchen and bedroom facing the courtyard. Alfred Messel desired to eliminate the Berlin dark rooms (rooms that received little natural light), ensuring every room had cross ventilation, natural light from both sides, and a water closet, and build ten stairways on the street level to service every apartment to avoid overcrowding the stairwell.38
Unique to Messel, he listened to future tenants’ recommendations and enlarged the kitchens in the corner apartments.39 Another benevolent feature were the stores and office on the ground level that became a feature in Messel’s and future architect’s plans. These stores included a bakery, hairdresser, tobacconist, grocery store, and two pubs. The stores met the tenant’s needs and facilitated today to today activities of the tenants. Tenants enjoyed public laundries and bathrooms in the attic, allowing daily chores to be done with ease. Another attribute were the public library and kindergarten located within the complex. Messel added the facility to attract the families of workers with an area that younger children; able to frolic in the courtyard, attend kindergarten, allowing parents to work in the home or other employment, and a public library to Messel designed many communal facilities into the design of the building besides the courtyard. Messel designed the façade in a lively way that differed from the surrounding buildings. 
	Alfred Messel designed the building in way that physically and ascetically separated it from surrounding areas. There is lively articulation to U-shaped structure that is like the Sickingenstrasse complex. At the Proskauer Strasse apartments gables are capped by saddleback roofs over the two side sections of Schreiner Strasse and Bänschstrasse..40  An integral feature is the building’s vaulted gable, facing the side street. It provides a unique character that surrounding buildings lack. During the building’s 120 years’ existence, a tower was removed from the corner, eliminating character from the building. Messel designed the building to have oriels that enlivened the façade but those have additionally been removed.41  All of these design features created a building provided affordable housing that featured “tactful eclecticism”42 and a separation from the Mietskaserne system. 
	Alfred Messel viewed the Mietskaserne as a plague to society beguiled by the greed of the architects and landowners who exploited the loose guidelines of Berlin’s housing codes. The Hobrecht Plan was created to ease the expansion of Berlin’s industry and transportation lines, focusing on the construction of roads to fully connect Berlin’s industries. Building codes specified simple regulations regarding building heights, positioning of lots, and the dimensions of buildings. These codes failed to specify health codes that would have protected the tenants and avoided the horrible conditions of the Mietskaserne, including cramped living spaces, low ventilation, dismal natural light, and rampant diseases. Messel architecture created a new form of affordable housing that created healthy living conditions. His methods included decreasing density on the lot, created smaller apartments, large courtyards with greenery, public facilities, and stores on the ground levels that facilitated daily life. While these improvements did not revolutionize Berlin housing, worker housing continued to follow Messel’s example and improve living conditions across Berlin.

“Little Yellow Riding Hood” A Grim (or maybe not) Fairytale By Thomas Frye ,"“Little Yellow Riding Hood” A Grim (or maybe not) Fairytale By Thomas Frye 
Once upon a time when half-hearted promises were no longer enough, there lived a girl who wore a yellow rain jacket that some called Little Yellow Riding Hood. For most of her life, politicians promised to the fix the problems plaguing the climate that will soon impact her generation. Their inability and inaction made her grow more disgusted and disappointed with each coming day. 
One day the disgust and disappointment erupted into motivation and inspiration. Little Yellow Riding Hood said to herself “Nobody else is doing anything. It is my moral duty to do what I can” so she skipped her schooling to sit outside her country’s parliament, calling for a climate strike. She sat alone outside most days. Some applauded her, while some called her an angsty teen just going through “a phase” that she’ll grow out of. 
Soon, word spread to other countries of a fearless young girl challenging politicians to take action. Others rallied around her cry to action, protesting and demanding their own lazy leaders to listen. While some countries took action, others continued towards Armageddon. She continued her strike until she was invited to speak at the UN climate conference. Her mother told her: “Look Little Girl. The earth isn’t doing well. I want you to travel across the world and tell politicians to get their heads outta millionaires’ wallets and listen to scientists. You better start now before it’s too late and gets too hot. When you travel, take a sailboat and don’t talk to orange ogres. Go save the world.” 
Little Yellow Riding Hood responded “I feel like I am dying inside—if I don’t” 
Little Yellow Riding Hood sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City. There she encountered the strange orange man that her mother had warned about. Little Yellow Riding Hood said, “Hello Mr. Orange Ogre what a hot record-breaking summer we’re having.” The orange Ogre failed to acknowledge Little Yellow Riding Hood despite her nastiest glare as he was too self-involved, drafting his Tweets for the night. The orange Ogre talked to the trolls around him 
“How can we further improve the economy at the cost of the environment” asked the orange Ogre 
“Increase cars’ carbon emissions allowance and subsidize coal!” said a troll, who thinks melting ice caps are a good thing. 
“Remove water protection laws and dump toxic chemicals into rivers. Who needs clean drinking water anyway? Not rich people!” said another troll, who lobbies for coal mines. 
“All excellent ideas to make a few people richer and make life harder for billions of people. A few dollars are worth the countless lives at stake.” said the crooked orange 
Ogre. “Now let’s head into this assembly, ignore everything and continue consuming our limited resources” 
Little Yellow Riding Hood followed in and saw the thousands of politicians representing the citizens of the world. There were hundreds of reporters, focusing their lens on the leaders fearlessly continuing their empty promises. 
Little Yellow Riding hood approached the podium to address the attending crowd. “I don’t want to be here. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood. And I’m the lucky one.” The ignorant orange man sat perched in crowd, plotting how he would troll Little Yellow Riding Hood on Twitter that night. “There are those who have to live with the effects of inaction and greed of a few.” 
After her speech, Little Yellow Riding Hood found the rotten orange man and asked: “Why what a Yuge mouth you have?” The orange Ogre mistook her for one of his own grandchildren and answered “Better to make false and outlandish accusations” the orange Ogre responded 
“Why what Yuge ears you have” 
“Better which to ignore scientists and listen to Faux News” 
“Why what Yuge hands you have” 
“Better which to sign bills to deregulate and harm the environment” 
“Why what Yuge fingers you have” 
“Better to tweet insulting tweets about little yellow riding hood.” 
At this moment, the revolting orange man pulled out his phone and tweeted “Little Yellow Riding Hood seems like a happy young girl. with such liddle’ hands. such a bright future ahead of her lying to us all just like Wolf Biltzer. I never lie. Just like my friend Putin.” This made Little Yellow Riding feel like she was swallowed whole with her grandmother by a wolf. A thought that seems so foreign yet so palpable. 
However, Little Yellow Riding Hood inspired millions of passionate young people. Millions created signs. Millions filled the streets. Millions called for action. Then billions rallied. Leaders acted, only at the risk of coup d’etat, and passed legislation that enforced strict environmental guidelines. Out of fear of being unelected, Lumberjacks Nancy Pepsi and Mitch McDonald found the orange Ogre in breach of his oath to his office. And they lived happily ever after. 
ALTERNATE ENDING 
Despite the valiant efforts of Little Yellow Riding Hood and the millions who rallied around her, politicians failed to enact change because a growing GDP is more important 
than clean water and air. Sea levels continued to rise. Typhons increased in frequency and strength. The ocean currents stopped as the waters around Green Land cooled too much. Soon the earth became unbalanced and billions suffered. People began to say, “We should have had listened to Little Yellow Riding Hood”. 
ANALYSIS 
“Little Yellow Riding Hood” endures a satirical interpretation of the classic tale Little Red Riding hood. Adapting the motifs and format of the Grimm’s Little Red Cap, I created a story focusing on modern occurrences and sentiments commonly felt by my generation. Yellow Riding Hood is based off of Greta Thunberg, the climate activist who protested outside the Swedish parliament in a yellow rain jacket. Her courage and determination are admired by people worldwide, paralleling the people that admired little red riding hood’s beauty (Tatar 18). In the Grimm’s version, the grandmother is ill, while in this rendition the Earth is plagued by greenhouse gas emissions causing global climate change (Tartar 18). Little Yellow Riding must go a journey across an ocean to “cure” climate change through disillusioning politician’s beliefs about climate change. On her journey, she encounters the orange Ogre (Donald Trump). Ogres are a common villain in many folktales and one is present in the “The False Grandmother” (Tatar 26). The Ogre and trolls are threats to Little Yellow Riding Hood, paralleling the threat of inaction and denial has on our current and future generations. Following the Grimm’s version of “Little Red Riding Hood”, “Little Yellow Riding Hood” features helpers (Tatar 19). The millions of people that rise to help Little Yellow Riding Hood represent the millions of people who participated in the global climate strikes. These commonalities and parallels are key structural elements of any folktale. 
According to Vladimir Propp in “Folklore and Literature”, folklore’s key characteristics include circulation and changeability (Propp). During the writing process, I shared the story with multiple friends via google doc. One friend told the story to her friends after visiting a few bars. Huddle around a coffee table drinking their nightcaps, my friend read “Little Yellow Riding Hood” to her friends, evoking laughter and the same frustrations held by Little Yellow Riding Hood. By sharing the story with friends, the story of Little Yellow Riding hood elevated to folklore status as the story circulated amongst many of UCSB’s social rings. The story’s strong sentiments around climate change’s effects and our dire future resonate with many people in my generation. The story serves as a coping mechanism as humans are facing an incredibly grim fate, catalyzed by inaction and falsehoods. The pop culture references to Donald Trump’s orange skin, mispronunciation of ‘huge’, and twitter tantrums reflect the near comedic status of American politics that nebulizes the merciless problems we face. Including these instances further emphasizes the coping role the story holds. A teenage girl tasked with protecting the planet from leaders practicing twitter diplomacy seems like a drifting nightmare, yet it is reality. People reading or listening are able to identify with the story in different ways than others. Some associate with the frustrations of politicians’ inaction and greed; some relate to frustrations of twitter diplomacy and general actions of Donald Trump. However, we can all recognize the importance of supporting a movement that we believe in and take action against those who want to make billions of people suffer in exchange for a healthy economy.

European Diplomacy 
 Humanity’s Demise 	
	The outbreak of the first world war was a combination of conscious and reckless decisions made by political leaders fueled by nationalism, armaments, alliances and financial ties. Political leaders maintained a balance of power across the continent, employing entangling alliances, deceits, war crazed militaries desperate for war. World War I left a scourge in Europe’s history, reminding humanity of the destruction and atrocities. 
	 For Serbian leaders, the borders of Serbia included “where a Serb dwells, that is Serbia”1 and nationalistic radicals strove to restore the traditional borders, liberating all Serbians of their fettered identities. This expansion path poised them directly against the Austrian Empire’s ambitions, causing future conflict over the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Dangerous nationalistic behavior escalated on the night of 11 June 1903, denoting a “new departure in Serbian political history”2. Twenty-Eight Serbian military officers led by Apis stormed the royal castle, executing the royal family and vital ministers, to ignite a coup d’état. The conspirators occupied four ministry positions and six party politicians, forming a threatening coalition that leveraged “to secure the most desirable military and government posts”3. The sudden reversal in government denoted a rapid degradation of an Austrian Economic partnership. Serbian weapon orders reverted to a French firm instead of the traditional Austrian firm. In a rash and fatuous reaction, the Austrian government boycotted Serbian pork exports, goading the Serbians to turn to the French for financial support. The French loans amounted to three-quarters of Bosnian debt, begetting a strong relationship between the two empires. Sudden splitting from the Austrian-Hungary Empire, Serbia severed the last possible attempts of forming amicable relations.
	The 1908 Austria-Hungary annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina resulted from a thirty- year occupation that most European powers felt indifferent towards, albeit the Serbian population erupted in an “unparalleled outburst of resentment and national enthusiasm”4.  In this period of immense nationalistic rage, the seven former conspirators formed the group “Ujedinjenje ili smrt” known as the black hand. The secret association adopted the declaration of the “unification of Serfdom 5” through any means necessary, impacting the world in July 1914. The groups secrecy rapidly diminished as it had over 2000 members and Serbian Prime Minister Pa?i? viewed the group led by Apis as a force seeking to intervene in solely internal affairs. In early 1914, Voja Tankosi?, directed by Apis, recruited three Bosnian Serbs, Trifko Grabe?, Nedeljko ?abrinovi? and Gavrilo Princip, to assassinate Franz Ferdinand in July. Armed with four revolvers and six small bombs, the trio crossed the Bosnia Border on 27 May 1914 with the assistance Serbian Border Officials, demonstrating the far-reaching influence the Black Hand had on the government that Pa?i? struggled to control. Pa?i? generally knew of the plot against Archduke Franz Ferdinand but his failure to properly alert Austria of the threat is nebulous. It is possible that he feared of the consequences from the black hand for alerting the Austrians or he favored the assassination and the movement to annex Bosnia. His failure intentionally resulted in a demise of humanity and the death of sixteen million people. 
	After the Austrian defeat in 1866 by the Prussian army, the empire resorted to a joint empire with the struggling Hungarian Empire, composing of two independent parliaments and only sharing a joint foreign affairs, defense, and financial ministries. The dual empire system was plagued by dysfunctionality, summarized by the first Hungarian prime minister Gyula Andrássy as “You look after your Slavs and we’ll look after ours”6.  The two empires faced intense internal problems, holding together by the fear of having worst. The Austrians refused to permit the Hungarians to raise a permanent army, proving disastrous as the Myganer elite refused to fund Austrian military expenditures. The massive bureaucracy expenditure increased “by 366 percent during the years 1890-1911”7 however inhabitants associated the costly organization with the benefits of a modern government, providing welfare, sanitation, and infrastructure. The Hungarian parliament was dominated by the Myanmar land owning class that possessed ninety percent of seats despite composing only half of the population. The relationship between the two empires remained delicate but stable if “the kingdom of Hungary continued to supply the funds and votes Vienna needed 8”. The first decade of the nineteenth century proved tremulous as the annexation of Bosnia triggered European backlash, Hungarian demands became increasingly demanding, and internal disputes regarding the military plagued the dual monarchy. 
	The conception of the Franco-Russian Alliance depicts German ignorance and the process the Triple Entente alienated Germany created irreversible yet avoidable circumstances that fueled the July crisis. The German unification wars created irreversible circumstances between Germany and France, starting when German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck annexed Alsace-Lorraine. After 1871, France sought to encumber Germany’s progress as a military through expanding an Anti-German alliance system. Bismarck was responsible for German prosperity during the late nineteenth century as his alliance system created an “overall political situation in which all powers, except France, … are kept by … as far as possible from forming coalitions against us (Germany)”9. Bismarck created the Reassurance Treaty of 1887 with Russia after an Austrian treaty strained Russian-German relations. In 1890, Bismarck’s successor Leo von Caprivi allowed for the Reassurance Treaty to lapse, affronting Bismarck’s delicate work and Russia’s importance as an ally. In a lapse in diplomatic anticipation, Germany left a Russian alliance for Austria-Hungary, allowing France to espouse a continental alliance with Russia. The Franco-Russian treaty created a dual front with Germany if the continental erupted, compelling Germany to seek new diplomatic relations. 
	After 1890, Russia began to fear Germany’s rapid ascent and intrusion into the balance of powers, noting Germany’s provocative industrial development and military strength, and feared an Anglo-German treaty, believing that “future threats to European Peace would be met by the union of England’s naval strength with the military strength of Germany”10.  Despite the unification of these empires, Britain evaded German offers for alliances, vacillating between the two “European camps”, only seeking closer relations in time of crisis. Additionally, colonial conquests pitted Britain and Germany against each other, particularly in the middle east, isolating Germany farther from the island nation.  A German naval advancement propelled Britain to an impasse with German diplomatic relations, escalating the stage for the first world war. Britain’s resolution to ally with France rather than Germany derived from “unsavory business … to influence the international press11”, German support of the Transvaal Republic, disdain towards British actions in South Africa, and Germany’s treatment of France, bullying the empire in hopes of entertaining a British relation. Germany’s rapid industrial development procured its isolation by Britain, observing German industrial output increase by 150 percent, metal production by 300 per cent, coal production by 200 percent12. The rapid production disturbed the continental balance of powers and spread fear amongst the British foreign office, corroborating the limits of British global dominance. 
	Analyzing the behavior and lifestyles of the European leaders and military officers evinces that the empires were plagued by a toxic nationalism, catapulting the empires to war. President remarked when he visited the continent that “It is militarism run stark mad13”. War general’s demands to increase conscript size, improve equipment, and renovate military infrastructure contended with politicians’ pleads to improve social programs and restrain reckless fiscal expenditures. The German government prioritized military spending by protecting the budget for five years, preventing parliamentary interference 14. In Great Britain, the navy budget consistently increased as naval officials argued the necessity to protect the colonies from foreign threats. The Russia Tsar closely aligned himself with senior officials, creating the obvious bias towards military needs.
	Perhaps the greatest influence of the war were the Balkan entanglements that solidified the Russian-Franco alliance, deepened regional conflict over territory, and isolated Berlin and Austria. After an Italian assault on Libya, various Balkan identities assaulted the aging Ottoman Empire, triggering an additional war over territorial claims fueled historic national identities. As the Ottoman Empire retracted from the region, Russian strategists viewed the region as potential spheres of influence as it began to intertwine France into the conflict. The two alliance systems faced different results after the second Balkan War. Austria-Hungary’s original strategy of utilizing the Ottoman Empire as a conservative and ordering force in the region ended in disaster. The wars demonstrated Austria-Hungary’s isolation as no empire recognized the legitimate security threat it faced with its southern neighbors. Even Germany, Austria’s main support, refused to back the country in the event of a Serbian conflict, as Wilhelm explicitly rejected any notion that Germany had to support Vienna against Belgrade. As Serbia’s largest financial guarantee, France adopted a belligerent stance, reporting to Russia that it is prepared to intervene in the instance of an Austrian invasion of Serbia. These alliances became crucial during the July Crisis.
	The morning of Sunday 28 June 1914 will forever remain a scar in European history when six members of the Black Hand assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie Chotek von Chotkowa in the streets of Sarajevo. There were miscommunication and blunders on both sides that attributed to ultimate the faithful ending of the Archduke. Archduke’s arrival was riddled full of miscommunication as his protective guard was left at the train station, police officers did not line the streets subduing the spectators, and his personal head guard rode in the police car that trailed the royal car. The first legitimate attempt failed as the assassin’s bomb denoted too late, exploding the car behind the Archduke’s. At Sarajevo’s city hall, the original plan was diverted and it was decided that the motorcade to take a different route than planned to the garrison hospital. However, upon departure it became obvious that no one elected to alert the drivers of the plans, sending the Archduke and his wife to their deaths. On this route, Gavrilo Princip pulled the trigger twice killing the Archduke and his wife. The ensuing reactions by the European States would have suggested that a continental war was avoidable. A continental war was avoidable until a Russian mobilization, prompting a German mobilization into Belgium. The German mobilization occurred after the Belgians refused to allow a peaceful temporary occupation by Germany, resulting in Belgian resistance and French support. 
Section 2
	During the early nineteenth century, rapid German development and industrial growth disrupted the global order causing isolation by the other major powers. Beginning in 1979 with market reforms, China emerged as an economic force, averaging a Gross Domestic Production average increase of nine and half percent15. This sudden economic explosion has sent ripples across the modern global order as China seeks to expand its influence across Asia and the Middle East, enjoining the United States to seek sanctions to quell Chinese influence and limit China’s production monopoly. From 1860-1913 the German share of global industrial production quadrupled, trailing the United States by 1913, and in 1913 Germany controlled thirteen percent of world trade, overtaking Britain in production and equaling in world trade. In 2016, China hegemonized the global merchandise trade, reporting 2.2 trillion US dollars of traded goods, and maintained a positive trade surplus in manufactured goods of 969.8 billion dollars; In 2016, the United States trailed China, recording 1.45 trillion dollars of traded goods, and reported a trade deficit of 504 billion dollars16. Germany employed the economic fruition to finance the Bulgarian government and offer other small empires loans, competing with French offers and previous Russian influence, and rivaled the British empire’s production, suggesting limits of the British global dominance. China pursues to spread its sphere of influence across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa with investment programs and the Belt and Road Initiative to rival former American support and open markets for its manufactured goods. As in the pre-world war Europe, finance projects still greatly influence international relations and came determine countries’ futures. In 1906, Serbia elected to severe monetary ties with Austria-Hungary, receiving loans from French banks and permanently aligned the empire with the French and Russian Empires. This reversal in relations further polarized the continent, escalading towards the war. Chinese investment programs in Pakistan total over $62 billion with unpredictable results. A rise in local tensions over Chinese funded projects resulted in extremist militant attacks on laborers in Gwadar, foreshadowing a possible rise in internal violence and unrest like the actions of the Black Hand in Serbia. 17
	In the east China Sea, territorial disputes over the Senkaku and Diaoyu islands between China and Japan parallel the territorial disputes in Bosnia- Herzegovina between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, highlighting the possible dangers of alliances, increased nationalism, mobilization implications, and increased armaments. Prior to the Austrian-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia- Herzegovina in 1908, the empire had occupied the region for over thirty years, causing indifference amongst the European powers except for Serbia who claimed historic national identity in the region. Serbian people reacted in “unparalleled outburst of resentment and national enthusiasm,18” causing the eventual creation of the Black Hand extremists group that assassinated Arch Franz Ferdinand of Austria. The Senkaku and Diaoyu islands were formally claimed by Japan in 1895; however, China claimed the islands in the 1970’s, reasserting historic identity ties to the islands19.  The United States expressed immediate concern, announcing the regions are protected by the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan that requires the countries to act in the event of an attack on Japan or the United States. The resulting tension resulted in a Chinese establishment of an air defense identification zone, controlling the identification and location of all aircraft in the region to protect national security20. Increasing national sentiments in China could erupt in unauthorized attacks on Japanese and American positions, resulting in an obligatory armed conflict between China and the US. The possible conflict could draw in NATO intervention as addressed by Article five of The North Atlantic Treaty. The entangled alliances of the US-Japan relations parallel those of the Triple Entente prior to 1914. Russia guaranteed support for Serbia in case of an Austrian invasion in the form of mobilization against Germany and Austria, forcing French intervention against Germany on the western front. The USA has led talks to de-escalate the region in hopes of avoiding another global conflict.
	National identity and an armament race plague the Middle East as Iran develops nuclear weapons, threatening to send the region into a War World I Balkans style crisis. A mix of toxic nationalism threatens to draw in the US, Russia, and Turkey to protect historic interest and economic clients. Iranian leaders adopted a belligerent attitude towards its neighbors, threatening to “wipe Israel off the map” and provoke wars with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The United States, China, Turkey, and Russia hold strong diplomatic and economic ties to the region and Iranian threats to its neighbors threatens to pull these countries into a costly war. Iran’s nuclear program posses a legitimate threat to global security as it refuses to confirm to international pressure, becoming increasingly unpredictable and violent. A nuclear strike by Iran has the potential to trigger a fallout as Israel, Turkey, and Turkey are in the range of Iranian missiles. The situation parallels the Balkan crisis as alliances, territorial disputes and an arms race escalated the continent to war.
	France’s road to war began in 1871 after the formation of the German Empire, stealing Alsace-Lorraine, and thus created a lasting enmity between France and Germany that drove the rest of Europe into an unfamiliar dynamic. After the German unification wars, French policy was to contain Germany by creating a system of anti-German alliances, later known as the Triple Entente. In 1890 France’s opportunity occurred when the German chancellor abstained from renewing the Reassurance Treaty with Russia. The two empires agreed to the treaty under a common understanding that an Anglo-German treaty would have distratous consequences, resulting in a full alliance in 1894.  In the initial stages of the Treaty French foreign minister Gabriel Hanotaux adopted a pungently anti-British agenda, waging an attack on the British presence in Egypt. A French force was to meet a British Force at the old Egyptian Outpost, Fashoda, nearly pushing the two powers to full out war till France retreated. Hanotaux’s predecessor, Théophile Delcassé, possessed highly anti-German sentiments, noting his disdain at the lost region Alsace-Lorraine. Declassé also choose an anti-British agenda, criticizing Britain’s actions in the Boer War, encouraging an invasion into Egypt, and proposing a war with Britain in 1900. In attempt to alienate Britain, Declassé proposed a coalition with Germany who demanded French recognition of the sovereignty of German rule in Alsace and Lorraine, terminating Declassé’s idea of German coalitions. By 1903, Declassé adopted the notion of forming a British entente to keep the European balance of power in order.  The Anglo-French entente formed as the British recognized France as the sole occupier of Morocco and France recognized Egypt as a British holding. These Ententes did not foreshadow an inevitable war but rather began Germany’s isolation.
	The French government possessed a unique dynamic from the rest of Europe, navigating in secrecy between departments within, and the foreign ministry, Qui d’Orsay, wielding power and autonomy. With ministries and cabinets shrouded in secrecy, there was a rapid and unstable rate of change amongst high ranking positions. President Casimir resigned after only six months, citing that the ministry of foreign affairs “failed to keep him informed even of the most important events 21”.  During the Morocco question, the French Ambassador to Berlin, Jules Cambon, sought an accord to put the crisis behind the empires, creating the Franco-German Accord in 1909 that excluded Berlin political initiative but allowed for the cooperation in the economic sphere. Jules Cambon’s brother, Paul Cambon, served as the French Ambassador to Great Britain, displaying particular behavior. He believed in French culture to the extent that he refused to learn English during his Ambassadorship of twenty-two years, rationalizing that French was the only language “capable of articulating rational thought 22”. While his rationale and behavior seemed boorish and elitist, Paul Cambon was the driving force in organizing the Franco-Anglo entente. After a series of weak foreign ministers, the government collapsed in 1911 and Jean Cruppi became the foreign minister. Cruppi reversed the delicate movements Jules Cambon and broke the Franco-German Accord of 1909, isolating Germany further. 
	In the summer of 1912, it was nebulous if France would support Russia in a Balkan conflict until Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré reversed the political direction. Poincaré publicly declared that France would conduct foreign policy “in the fullest agreement with her ally 23”. The sudden foreign metamorphosis procured from his perceived threat of the German empire, believing that a Franco-Russian Alliance fortified French security. Jules Cambon described Poincaré as an organized in which “everything is numbered, classed, recorded, as in a file (295)”. His calculated thought process explained his decision to fully support Russian ambitions in the Balkans, predicting an outbreak of a general war and the Russian invasion in Russia. Poincaré consistently debated the balance of power in Europe with the ambition of demoting Germany. When elected president of the Republic, Poincaré exploited every power bestowed upon him by the constitution.  He handpicked his successor, Charles Jonnart, who relied on Maurice Paléologue, Poincaré’s favorite political ally, to operate the foreign affairs department. Poincaré strove to enhance the military, raising a French army of 700,000 men, to match German strength.
	Across Paris, the news of the Archduke’s death hardly resonated with the people enthralled with the Madame Caillaux murder trial of Gaston Calmette. French newspapers dedicated the Serevjo incident half the lines the Caillaux trial received, blaming the Austrians for erupting anti-Serbian sentiments. On 15 July, Poincaré, newly appointed prime minister René Viviani and Pierre de Margerie boarded the battleship France for the journey to St. Petersburg. On the journey, the trio debated many topics afflicting the French government including the speech by Charles Humbert that exposed the dire conditions French armaments suffered compared to German weaponry and communication. While the meeting in St. Petersburg’s official notes disappeared, accounts and journal entries depict a scene where the foundation for continental war solidified. During the meetings, a colonel of the French army cheered “to the next war and a certain victory 24. The cheering military officers illustrate a dangerous combination of bored military officers and a volatile regional conflict.

A Comparison of Australian and New Zealand Attempts of Reconciliation ,"Thomas Frye 
30 August 2019 
A Comparison of Australian and New Zealand Attempts of Reconciliation 
“Compare and contrast the reconciliation processes between the state and Indigenous peoples of two countries and discuss their similarities, differences and successes or otherwise.” 
During the nineteenth and twentieth century, settler governments committed 
inhumane acts against indigenous groups, condemning the groups to future 
disadvantages. Beginning in the 1970s, Australia’s and New Zealand’s governments 
began the reconciliation processes to correct these events and improve indigenous 
outcomes. However, the majority of these policies and actions fail to seek a shared 
understanding of justice between the native population and state. The settler 
governments detrimental actions exceed the lackluster attempts to reconcile, revealing a 
dire situation for indigenous peoples that must be counteracted with new reforms. 
Historical Background 
In the eighteenth-century British colonizers began to disturb the Aboriginal and 
Māori peoples’ lives and cultures, employing the notion of Terra Nullius to justify their 
expansion and exploitations. Terra Nullius translates to empty land, influencing 
Australia and New Zealand to create policies that warranted settlers’ forceful removal of 
peoples for grazing, agriculture, and industry1. The settlers’ erected the notion of 
manifest destiny on racism and capitalism, contrasting the indigenous people’s spiritual 
connections to the land, and created the stage for centuries of conflicts and sufferings. 
1Palmiste, Claire. “Forcible Removals: The Case of Australian Aboriginal and Native American Children.” AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Peoples 4, no. 2 (2008): 78 
The actions of the Australian governments vary greatly from deceptions, land 
removals, child abduction to cultural genocide. Aboriginals attached their spirituality 
and lives to the land, believing that their lives were intertwined with the land from birth 
to the afterlife. The colonial government instituted the pastoral lease system to begin to 
sever the aboriginal’ land attachment, permitting the settlers access to the land for 
agriculture and the aboriginal access for spiritual reasons, albeit failed to prevent the 
settlers from massacring thousands of aboriginals2. Continuing to desecrate the 
aboriginal culture, the Australian government instituted the child removal acts to 
purposely eradicate and transform Australia into a white nation. Australian officials 
initially targeted half-caste children, attempting to bread out the aboriginal from the 
white, and removed the children from their families and ancestral lands into 
apprenticeships and forced labor.3 The continued removal of children severed ties to 
their families, producing deep resentment in the children of their families, and began 
the process of committing cultural genocide. Removing the children destroyed their 
bonds to the ancestral land, a difficult process to undo and compensate for. Beginning in 
the 1970’s, demands of reconciliation and political organization rooted within the 
aboriginal community. 
In 1854, the English Acts Act transferred all English laws to New Zealand settlers, 
believing that the laws were inclusive enough to maintain order, albeit Māori and 
English concepts vastly contrasted. To compensate for this, early legislation targeted 
Māori land ownership, customs, and language. Beginning in the 1840’s, the Land Wars 
2 Short, Damien. “Reconciliation, Assimilation, and the Indigenous Peoples of Australia.” International Political Science Review 24, no. 4 (2003): 492 3 Palmiste, Forcible Removals, 81 
matriculated into massacres of Māori people, large scale land seizures, and the 
destruction of communities4. These land removals severed the Māori from their 
ancestral homeland, disrupting their lives and overall health. Then in 1863, the New 
Zealand Settlements Act and Native Land Act confiscated three million acres for Pākehā 
usage.5 The 1867 Native School Act further fragmented Māori culture and heritage. 
Māori children were abused for speaking Māori in school, leading widespread emotional 
and physical abuses6. Settler actions deliberately attempted to eradicate Māori culture 
through land seizures, child abuse, and consistent deceit. 
Reconciliation Process 
In order for a successful reconciliation process, policies and legislation must 
come from a shared understanding of justice in which the indigenous and settler 
government can both agree on. In New Zealand, the concept of justice derives from the 
Treaty of Waitangi; however, Meredith Gibbs describes the shared notion as limited and 
“argues that a notion of reparation as reconciliation - in a Maori context, restoring the 
balance” creates a better future7. Australia and Aboriginal officials do not have a treaty 
that both bodies can agree of as a shared understanding of justice. Aboriginal bodies 
claim, since they are descendants of the original inhabitants of the land, that their right 
to self-determination never ceased and carry a distinction from other migrated 
minorities8. The Australian government refused to allow this right, fearing of a national

London, England: Routledge, 138 
unity crisis and territory disputes. While these justice interpretations differ, government 
actions and inaction have created widely varying results between the two countries. The 
governments’ reconciliation policies have ultimately failed to fully compensate and 
correct past atrocities. 
Beginning in the 1970’s, indigenous groups assembled, demanding for 
reparations and acknowledgement of past monstrosities. In 1975, New Zealand 
lawmakers created the Waitangi Tribunal to settle future claims of not upholding or 
respecting the Treaty of Waitangi, expanding the jurisdiction later to encompass all 
injustices from 18409. Australia’s legislators adopted multiculturalism officially in 1973 
and passed the Racial Discrimination Act in 197510. These different legal proceedings 
reflect the respected countries’ understandings of justice. The Treaty of Waitangi serves 
a permanent fixture of a bicultural narrative where sovereignty derives from the Maori 
and Crown’s relationship. This allowed New Zealand and the Māori to create a system to 
seek justice for past injustices. Despite the cross-cultural platform’s benefit, the tribunal 
has severe limitations. The tribunal fails to hold any power to bind the Crown to its 
findings and the Crown can dissolve or restrict the tribunal’s function, reinforcing 
colonial power structures11. Although flawed, Māori have successfully lodged claims to 
the tribunal to retrieve stolen land. In 1984, a group of Ngati Whatua of Orakei claimed 
wrongful deprivation of seven hundred-acre plot after the government demanded 
$200,000 for the land. Three years later the tribunal sided with Ngati Whatua and

highlighted that the Crown failed to adhere to the treaty, recommending the Crown to 
protect the property and rights of the habu12. While there are success stories, there 
remains much stolen land that needs to be restored to Māori ownership. 
While strides have occurred to correct past events, the current status of Māori 
disadvantage prove a failed reconciliation process. Māori peoples constitute the majority 
of New Zealand’s prison system, demonstrating prescient institutional racism and biases 
in law enforcement and the legal system. Despite this imbalance, no current legislation 
or policies exist to effectively this pandemic. Reconciliation policies must target the core 
of this problem. Investigations and modeling must be issued to analyze the source of the 
incarceration rates, hypothesizing if increased incorporation of Māori ideals and input 
into policies will begin generational change and lower Māori disadvantage. In order for 
these policies to benefit Māori communities, the Crown must allocate sufficient funding 
and fully support these policies. 
During the 1980s and 1990s, the Hawke and Keating governments created 
legislation that granted aboriginal peoples some forms of self-determination and 
furthered reconciliation efforts. Hawke focused on primarily land reform, returning land 
rights to aboriginals dispossessed by past removal policies, and extended aboriginal 
ability to veto mining projects13. Land is an essential foundation of aboriginal culture 
and spirituality, thus returning land rights begins the process of cultural reconciliation. 
In a landmark decision, Hawke allowed for the creation of Aboriginal and Torrey Strait 
Islander Commission (ATSIC), allowing indigenous peoples to actively contribute on 
12 “Waitangi Tribunal Te Rōpū Whakamana i Te Tiriti o Waitangi.” Resolving the grievances of the past | Waitangi Tribunal. Accessed August 29, 2019. 13 Langfield, “Indigenous Peoples 139 
legislation affecting their lives and future generations14. The ATSIC granted the 
indigenous peoples a voice and a path towards self-determination, allowing for policy 
contribution, lobbying, and educating other lawmakers on indigenous social issues. 
During 1991 and 1992, Keating’s government created the Reconciliation Council- 
striving to educate non indigenous peoples about history and culture and address social 
justice issues- and issued a formal apology that acknowledged the abuses inflicted on 
the aboriginal peoples15. Despite these improvements, true self-determination and 
reconciliation were distant ideas. Several policies and legislation, including the Native 
Title Act and land funds, placed the burden of proof of land ownership on the 
aboriginals16. In order to prove ownership, a truth must be formulated the land is 
connected to culture. Forming this truth proves difficult because of massive removal 
actions during the early twenty centuries that cut cultural ties to the land and the notion 
of ownership differed greatly between the two bodies. When the British applied the 
Terra Nullius to the occupation, settlers assumed no person owned the land, making the 
land theirs. However, aboriginal peoples viewed land as a communal element. The 
Waitangi Tribunal shares a similar impediment, requiring a true history to reference 
when determining injustices. In most colonized regions, facts have been biased and 
misconstrued from the victor’s or settler perspective and oral versions are difficult to 
verify. Without a shared and accepted definition of history by negotiating parties, justice 
is difficult to achieve.

During the Howard government, deliberate and malicious actions occurred to 
limit reconciliation processes and distance the government from any guilt. In 1996, the 
High Court issued the Wik decision, manifesting that pastoral leases do not relinquish 
native titles and co-existence was viable17. In response, Native Title Amendment Act of 
1998 vastly limited native title, receiving condemnation from the United Nations 
Committee for the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination18. The Howard 
government can only be described as racist and cruel. Their motivations derive from 
capitalistic endeavors, reinforcing colonial power structures. 
In Australia, legislators ignored aboriginal self-determination demands, 
attempting to group Aboriginals as merely another racial minority. The aboriginals did 
not willingly migrate or assimilate into the settler state. Therefore, they are considered a 
separate ethnic group with policies pertaining to their disadvantage. Without granting 
even limited self-determination to the aboriginal, the Australian government failed to 
accommodate and make amends with the indigenous population. 
To reverse the disadvantages first nation peoples face every day, governments 
must act rationally and with compassion. In a rational response, governments must 
dictate laws and processes based off of shared understandings of justice. Australia must 
compromise and allow the Aboriginals to create a path towards self-determination. New 
Zealand must continue creating policies that counteract the root of indigenous 
disadvantage, funding projects entirely and establishing monitoring systems and goals 
to ensure success. Governments must create education plans that explore indigenous

stereotypes that support institutional racism. Without an impactful reconciliation 
process that strives for justice, the wounds of colonization will never heal.

Helping Relationships in the Real World paper
Career Peer Advising 




























Andrea Ludovina

CNCSP 101: Intro to Helping Skills
TA: Liz McGarry
Section: Thursday 12pm 










































For the last two years I have been working as a Career Peer Advisor for UCSB Career Services. In this position I am not only responsible for assisting career counselors with program development but most importantly assisting and advising students in their initial stages of career planning and providing appropriate referrals to advisors, counselors, and other campus agencies as needed. In my position I am the first face a student sees when walking into Career Services. I help troubleshoot any general questions they have but sit down with the student and have a one on one “drop in” if their concern requires so. I greet a very diverse population of students ranging from first years to graduate students, from Art majors to Engineering majors, and everything in between. A huge strength I would say I have in this role is knowing my limits of help and knowing when to refer them to a better resource or a more knowledgeable person. Typically when a student comes in to the Career Resource Room I have to gauge where they are at emotionally. Sometimes students come in sweating and with tears in their eyes because they are graduating in a quarter and have no idea what they want to do with their life. Other times a student will come in gleaming with excitement, eager to plan their future. As a peer advisor I find the utmost gratification helping a student in any stage or aspect of their career goal, even if it is as simple as being their only support outlet for what they want to do. 
The article “Importance of Empathy for Social Work Practice: Integrating New Science,” by Karen E. Gerdes and Elizabeth Segal explains the significance of empathy and how clients experiencing empathy through treatment have improved outcomes. Gerdes and Segal define empathy as the ability to identify with another person's emotions. They state that people in helping roles should connect more empathetic with clients in order to make them less vulnerable to becoming overwhelmed, burnt out, or hopeless. I believe that this article could not be more accurate, especially since I see the benefits of approaching a student in an empathetic manner. When a student walks into my work disheartened because they didn’t get the job they wanted or because they didn’t get into the major they wanted to pursue, by relating with their emotions and taking a nonjudgmental, accepting reflection of the student’s emotional state I am better able to help. Sometimes the student I am helping just needs support or reassurance that they will be okay and not always a job offer. 
Another course article, “Rapport and Relationship,” describes the importance of establishing rapport and a positive therapeutic relationship. It goes further into explaining that people who choose to become mental health providers must be able to offer a rather unique relationship to their clients. That this relationship “incorporates many elements of a social relationship, a friendship relationship, and an intimate relationship, and yet it is none of these.” This really resonated with me because when I am helping a student, although I am a fellow student myself, I have to establish not only a professional relationship with them, but an empathetic and friendly one as well. The article delves deeper in explaining that the goal is to create a counseling atmosphere that communicates respect for the client, a warmth and accepting deposition, and a willingness to commit to a serious effort to be of help. My goal when assisting students is to establish this welcoming environment where I can help answer their question in the most efficient and friendly way so that they feel comfortable coming back when they have another question. The article explains how empathy, genuineness, and positive regard are essential characteristics of an effective therapeutic relationship. I agree with this because not only does it increase the opportunity for students to achieve their goals, but also serves as a model of a healthy interpersonal relationship. 
Branching off of establishing a good relationship with your client, ethical issues come into the picture. The article “Ethical Issues in Helping,” states the ethical codes of conduct and the principles one has to follow in helping professions.  The article defines ethics as “principles and standards that ensure that professionals provide quality services and are respectful of the rights of the people with whom they work.”  In my role as a Peer Advisor I have encountered several ethical issues as a beginner helper. I received over 10 hours of training where I was taught the rules for confidentiality and what I can or can not disclose to students. One ethical issue I encounter most often is developing appropriate boundaries. Because the population that I help are my fellow peers, sometimes I am helping a friend of mine, or an acquaintance I know from class. This affects the interpersonal nature of the interaction because it is difficult to be objective when listening to the problems of friends. What I found to be successful is to just approach them in a professional manner rather than a more casual way, so I can help them with any questions. 
Speaking of questions, my role as a Career Peer Advisor is to find a solution or point the student to a solution. For this reason I employ solution-oriented questions in almost every interaction I have. The Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association’s “Solution-oriented Questions: An Analysis of a Key Intervention in Solution -Focused Therapy” explains the concept of solution focused therapy and the concepts underlying this therapy. The article illustrates how there are four assumptions in a solution-focused intervention: “(a) clients bring strengths and abilities to therapy, (b) a working Partnership between therapists and clients is required, (c ) clients can construct future oriented, positively worded goals, and (d) actions necessary for reaching these goals can be identified and implemented.” I couldn’t agree more with these underlying assumptions. If a student walks into Career Services hopeless looking for guidance and change, they themselves have to be prepared for guidance and change. If they do not want to put in the effort and can’t see themselves reaching their goals then there’s not much I can do for them. The article considers these limitations by pointing out that one must take into consideration the client’s characteristics, timing and pacing, and even your own (therapist) characteristics as well. With these in mind, then you are better able to troubleshoot by looking at the reality of the situation and mobilizing hope. Regardless, I always try to install hope when a student walks in defeated and unsure of their future. But in order for them to set some goals and reach them, they are going to have to have the desire and drive on their end too.
The underlying belief that I as a Career Peer emphasize along with every Career Counselor, is to find what makes you happy and to do it. Often times a student with come in with tears in their eyes on the verge of dropping out because they are flunking out of Organic Chemistry and they hate being a Biology major. The first thing we ask is why they chose to study biology and more often than not students will say their parents want them to be a doctor. The article “The New Science of Happiness,” by Claudia Wallis attempts to find out what makes us as humans happy. What the article concluded was that Americans are overwhelmingly happy and optimistic people, regardless of income. As a Career Peer I am a firm believer that if you study what you love then you will do well in it. If you pursue a career you find fulfillment and joy from, you will be happy with it. Simply following a certain career track just because of the income could be disastrous and draining. Students could risk the event of burning out or being unhappy. Wallis suggests eight steps toward a more satisfying life is to 1. Count your blessings, 2. Practice acts of kindness, 3. Savor life’s joys, 4. Thank a mentor, 5. Learn to forgive, 6. Invest time and energy in friends and family, 7. Take care of your body, and 8. Develop strategies for coping with stress and hardships.  When analyzing these 8 steps there is nothing hinting or relating to money. In fact, Wallis’s biggest recommendation for lasting happiness is to figure out your strengths and find new ways to deploy them. At Career Services we stand by this one hundred percent. We even offer online assessments to students where they can figure out their strengths and where those strengths would be best applied to. You can’t put a salary on happiness, but you can work to be happier. 
        My experience as a Career Peer Advisor has enabled me to become a more empathetic and understanding person when engaging in helping relationships. When friends and family come to me with their problems I am better able to listen and understand where they are coming from. My role and experience working at Career Services has shown me not only the diverse population of students that attend UCSB, but also the same struggles that every person faces in their life. How they want to choose to spend their lives, where they should devote their time, etc. It has been a privilege to be exposed to all the campus resources and  surrounded by all the career counselors and work with my peers. This experience affects my approach to helping and future plans for engaging in helping relationships by enabling me to approach any human being- friend, stranger, peer- and being able to help them appropriately.

For the “Greater Good” of the Economy: Gender and Racial Inequalities

        From the 1820s to the 1920s, the history of the United States illustrates how labor systems relate directly to gender and racial inequalities.  Whether it was based off gender or based off race, they have a direct correlation with the labor systems during that period. In this paper I will be examining how racial ideologies/ free labor ideology correlate directly with slavery at that time and how they go hand in hand. I will also examine the domestic ideology  and how it affected the factory work/ IHP for women. By analyzing primary sources from Sarah Grimké and Louis Godey we are able to see how women of this time period were tied to certain roles and functions in society. In Examining Sojourner Truth and William Garrison’s works we see how America chose to produce their material needs depending racialized forms of social inequality. By looking at both racial and gender inequalities in relation to labor systems in America we are able to see the justification behind both being that is was the most efficient/ effective forms of labor for the economy according to society at that time. 
        One of the earliest labor systems in the US were Independent Household Producers (IHP). In this system, families were mostly self sufficient farm households that were loosely integrated in the market. This system was built upon a nuclear heterosexual marriage which produced a large family to help grow the farm in prime producing years. Sexual and generational division of labor was also very present in this system. Older female children for example, would marry into a neighboring farm families, while the youngest male child would inherit the arm and support the mother and father in old age.[1] Godey’s Lady’s Book promotes this domestic ideology exclaiming how the “profession of ladies, to which the bent of their instruction should be turned, is that of daughter, wives, mothers, and mistresses of families.” [2]Godey contends that men and women were best suited to preside over different spheres. That women possessed talents and virtues best suited for home while men’s nature and talents suited them to preside over the public sphere of business and politics. This labor system (IHP) revolves around the domestic ideology that restrains women to the home for  reproductive labor because of their “natural” qualities to do so. By examining this domestic ideology we can see how women are restrained to this domestic role of work/ labor system. Godey depicts how the value of women was in the home. That by being at home was far more beneficial than earning an income because women were endowed with moral goodness superior to men according to the Bible, therefore men need women to subdue themselves and their natural selfish passions and animal prosperities. 
While most middle class women accepted the dictates of domestic ideology, some women began to question it. With the industrialization of production and women beginning to work outside of the home in factories, more women began to speak out about the gender inequalities that existed. Sarah Grimké calls for greater equality in her letter “On the Condition of Women in the United States.”[3] Here she describes how a women’s education “is miserably deficient; that they are taught to regard marriage as the one thing needful…”[4] Grimké basically contests the belief that a women’s main duty is to get married and have a family. That women’s education should be improved and they are far more capable than culinary and domestic duties. By examining this primary source of this time period we are able to understand the shift in thought and gender inequalities with the change of labor systems. Now that women (and society) are entering capital intensive factories, free labor ideology came into play. Contrasting Domestic ideology, Free labor ideology offers the opportunity of more freedom to the wage earners, particularly women. While Grimké calls for greater equality, her argument does not completely dismiss the domestic ideology, but merely seeks to reform it. The significance in this is that, like Godey, Grimké sees the value of women in the domestic sphere. That women, by doing their duties thoroughly and understandingly, increase the happiness of the family and save a huge amount of time and money. Grimké explains how “the influence of women over the minds and character of children of both seces is allowed to be far greater than that of men.” The rise of the “public” woman was not a rebellion against old ways during this time period, but rather a call for equality.
Document six, “Sojourner Truth Links Women’s Rights to Antislavery” was an address that Truth, a former slave, gave to the Women’s Rights convention in 1851. She argues for the extension of equal rights and franchise to all woman- not just white women. In a similar fashion as Grimké and Godey, Truth challenges the central tenets of domestic ideology but doesn't dismiss it completely. Like her white middle-class contemporaries, she touches upon the lack of education women recieve and how men justify it “cause Christ wasn’t a woman!”[5] By appealing to religion, Truth attempts to undermine the justification of God and religion as a way to oppress women in certain roles. She finds herself struggling in two different labor systems due to her gender and race. Because she had to do the duties of a slave she exclaims “look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me!” [6] Truth explains how she had the duties and labors of a man but was still expected to be a woman even though she was never “helped into a carriage.” Truth expresses  her concerns with not only being a women, but being and African American women and the two labor systems she was confined in.
Labor systems not only related to gender inequalities but racial inequalities as well. African Americans were funneled into a Chattel Slavery Labor system. The Southern economy organized this labor system around the monocrop of cotton from roughly 1800 to the Civil War. It gave rise to Southern ‘slavocracy’ dominated by big plantation-owning elite, justifying for racist ideologies. This labor system was very tortuous and intensive fueled by pro slavery ideology. This way of thinking was practiced by many. Thomas Jefferson explaining that “slavery is a necessary evil,” John C. Calhoun promoting that “slavery is a positive good,” etc.[7] William Lloyd Garrison’s “Call for the Immediate Abolition of Slavery” was published in a prominent abolitionist paper in 1831. Garrison appeals to American ideals such as the Declaration of Independence to support his argument for abolitionism. How the “self evident truth maintained in the American Declaration of Independence, ‘that all men are created equal, and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights- among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,’ shall strenuously contend for the immediate enfranchisement of our slave population.”[8] By using the Declaration of Independence to support his argument that African American deserve human rights, Garrison is able to contest the President’s common justifications for slavery. Additionally, in lecture Professor Stephens explained how many Presidents have seen the atrocities of slavery but see the benefits of it as a labor system; Thus describing slavery as a labor system an “evil good.”
In a similar fashion, Document eight “George Fitzhugh Attacks Wage Labor,” also touches on this topic of slavery being an “evil good” for the economy. George Fitzhugh equates slavery with “moral cannibalism” because the master would exploit or “eat” the profits of slaves. Fitzhugh explains how slaves were actually generally happy due to the economic dynamic that accounted for the difference between wage laborers and slaves. Although Fitzhugh was a proponent of the positive defense of slavery, it is interesting to see his justifications for the slave labor system. He states how because slaves are so oppressed they actually enjoy more liberty. And because of this, this is why racial inequality and slave labor work so well. 
        By examining primary sources that were written by those who have been oppressed themselves due to the gender and racial inequalities established through the labor systems, we are able to see their perspectives on this issue. Grimké, Godey, and Truth’s pieces for example, all call for reform in terms of equality for women but still do not oppose the systems they are tied to. They see that women are confined to more of a domestic sphere in society however, they see the reasoning behind why that is so and how that is more efficient than having the man do it. Garrison and Fitzhugh give us insight of slave labor and the racial ideologies that fuel that system as well. Both gender and racial ideologies correlated with the labor systems because society saw it as the optimal way the economy could run. For these reasons race and gender are interrelated with labor systems.

The issue of interracial relationships has historically been a difficult one for the U.S. There has been decades of laws prohibiting such relationships, therefore American attitudes towards them has continued to be extremely negative until present day. Over the past several decades, desegregation of neighborhoods, schools, and the workplace has aided in bringing individuals from different racial groups together ( Kantsman, 2004). With this increase number of people of color in the workplace, schools, and all other aspects of life, and higher levels of interpersonal contact, the potential for interracial relationships is going to rise (Harris & Kalbfleisch, 2000).  In most classic or normative romance stories, they depict a white heterosexual couple. Through my zine I hoped to portray the same plots of most romantic novels, movies, and stories but at the end reveal a picture of my boyfriend and I. Through this I hoped to illustrate how love has no race, color, religion gender, etc. How we are all humans and that love is love. 
In my own personal experience I started my interracial relationship almost three years ago, my freshman year in college. Growing up as a girl in the United States my entire adolescence was filled with movies, books, and images of same- race couples. I never thought this affected my preference in who I found attractive but soon realized it affected how others viewed interracial couples. I remember distinctly when my boyfriend and I first started dating  and I told him that I told my dad. The first thing that my boyfriend Lamar asked was “did you tell him I was Black?” This is the first time that color has been brought to my attention in our relationship. Throughout the years there has been comments made and looks that have been given that haven't happened in my previous relationships which happened to be same-race. Walking down the streets of my college town, drunk students will yell “Wow! What a beautiful couple, good for you guys!” Or just disapproving stares from people. My parents were extremely supportive of my relationship and never asked what Lamar’s race was- even though his name probably gave them an idea. So it came to me as a shock when Lamar asked if I had told my dad his race. The emotion I felt when he asked me this was sad and shocked. Sad that that was the first concern Lamar had when I told my dad about him, and shocked that this was our reality. 
My zine depicts typical love scenes or activities that most couples do. I challenge the reader/viewer to honestly think what they imagined the skeletons were. Did you assume that they were a female and male? Did you picture them as the same race? In my opinion most people would view them as so. I attribute this normative assumption on society's portrayal of romantic couples through music, movies, ads, books, etc. For example, Disney’s most popular movie ever ranked was “Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs” (1937).  The plot of this fairy tale entails a jealous wicked queen who orders the murder of her step daughter and later gives her a poisoned apple causing the step daughter to fall into a death- like sleep that can be broken only by a kiss from the prince. This romance story between the step daughter and the prince depicts a same-race (White) heterosexual relationship. In fact, most Disney movie plots follow this normative romance story of a white woman falling in love with a white man. Given Disney’s prominence in the movie world and it’s overall popularity, this has a huge influence on the audience viewing it. Not only does it paint a fairy tale image of what love looks like, but it also implies a norm for it. For this reason it does not come to me as a surprise that when most people envision a couple on a date they picture a white male and a white female. 
Another form in which romance stories are widely spread in society  are through songs. I personally remember growing up thinking that a boy and girl should fall in love because that is what is normal. As an adolescent growing up in the 2007-2015 era Taylor Swift gained extreme fame and popularity. One of her most successful songs “Fifteen” illustrated a love story between a boy and a girl. She sang how “ when you're fifteen, Somebody tells you they love you, You're gonna believe them.” The music video solidifies this heteronormative concept showing Taylor Swift (a White girl) falling in love with a White boy. I remember singing this song at the top of my lungs with my friends, so excited to find a love like illustrated in this music video. 
These two examples demonstrate how due to the media's significant influence on societal expectations and norms, our perception of what a romantic relationship should look like it set for us. In most classic or normative romance stories, they depict a white heterosexual couple. Through my zine I hoped to portray the same plots of most romantic novels, movies, and stories but at the end reveal a picture of my boyfriend and I. By doing this I hope to challenge society’s norm of what a romantic relationship should look like. I hope to challenge the people who feel the need to overly give approval of my boyfriend’s and I's relationship. I hope to challenge those people who feel the need to blatantly disapprove of my boyfriend’s and I’s relationship. I hope to dismantle the idea that there is such a thing as a “normal” relationship, because with that standard it gives room to the  belief that if there’s a relationship that doesn’t fit that norm- it’s wrong.

African Literature 
4 December 2018 


African literature is a means through which African writers engage their realities, fantasies, ideas, and culture. The literal definition of African literature is still an ongoing project because we have the issue of declaring a normative standard of African literature. When it comes to African literature there are a few names that are associated with it. By simply googling “Distinguished writers in African Literature,” Chinua Achebe is the first name that pops up. Why is that? According to google, he is one of the world's most widely recognized and praised writers, writing some of the most extraordinary works of the 20th century. This paper will not only analyze what constitutes a distinguished writer in African Literature - looking specifically at Chinua Achebe- but also looking at why this is so. By examining Chinua Achebe’s most popular novel “Things Fall Apart” and scholarly sources centered around African Literature we are able to see what makes Achebe such a distinguished writer.
Born in 1930 in Southeastern Nigeria, Achebe was an excellent student, ultimately gaining a scholarship to further his education landing him into writing. He was perhaps the first to give voice and insight to the other side of the world (western readers) of African writing. In an interview with Achebe, Abdul-Rasheed Na’allah addresses the issue of African literature, and its successes in the Americas. He asked Achebe how he assesses African writing thus far and Achebe said he is ultimately pleased with its progress. He goes into exclaiming how “there’re still thousands and thousands of stories, of conditions of our present, of our past, of our future waiting to be addressed”(Na’allah 191). Achebe then goes further into explaining how their political situation and country’s infrastructure has prohibited even the ability for most people to write. How the political situation “tends to divert attention… the disappearance of infrastructure in the country, the disappearance of paper, the expense of books, and so on” (191). Here, Achebe illuminates the struggles and obstacles most African writers face just to even write. He explains that although dangerous situations could develop in Nigeria, they should assist, protect, and encourage one another, and continue writing. Achebe’s drive to continue writing despite political dangers and lack of resources definitely contributes to his title of a distinguished African writer. Achebe not only pushes past these obstacles as an African writer himself, but he encourages others to do the same. One of the ways he did this was by organizing the Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA) to set the pace for the arrival of other African writers, particularly from his own native Nigeria. By not only introducing the word to African literature but also pathing the path for more writers to come, Achebe earned the title of a distinguished African writer. 
When African literature is taught to a western audience, Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart” is typically in the course curriculum. By reading this novel, non-African readers are exposed to aspects of the novel that are specific to the culture in and of which it was written. By examining Achebe’s novel, “Things Fall Apart,” one is able to see the culture, traditions, and societal norms in Africa making this novel so significant. Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart,” touches upon the concept of masculinity in African culture. The main protagonist Okonkwo is far too masculine, and his wife Unoka is far too feminine. This shows the reader the androgynous society that is typically represented in African culture. Achebe’s novel also elucidates on African tradition versus African contemporary values. In the novel, Okonkwo wants to stick to old traditions and has no room to accommodate for anything new or different and how others frowned upon this. Okonkwo’s unwillingness to adapt and change shows how African society isn’t rigid like how most Europeans have described it. In fact, Achebe’s novel shows how flexible and willing African societies are to change. It also demonstrates the role that community plays in Africa. The community society functions on consensus and if one were to act against the community’s wishes (like Okonkwo did when he broke the week of peace) they will abandon that person. So not only does this novel shed light on gender and the roles they play in society, but also on the role that the community plays on the individual.  
In terms of presenting African culture, Achebe does this throughout the novel by Ikemefuna. Ikemefuna had to be sacrificed rather than his guilty father simply because of the role that first sons play in regard to their father  in African societies. The first son is suppose to bury his father, and it is shameful and disgraceful for a father to lose his first son. How African culture approaches burial, death, family, gender, society and more all are illustrated in Achebe’s novel. In Tanure Ojaide’s “African Literature and its Context: Teaching Teachers of Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart,” he explains how Achebe gives a balanced portrayal of traditional and precolonial Africa. How Achebe “presents the strengths and weaknesses of the culture. Among the many strengths is the way it balances latitude for the individual with the needs of a communal society” (Ojaide 173). For this reason, Achebe’s novel “Things Fall Apart,” is typically included in most African Literature classes. Achebe includes several aspects of African society, culture, and traditions in this single novel which is another reason why he is such a distinguished writer. He is able to not only portray Africa but also compare African and modern European cultures.
Another reason that Achebe is such a distinguished African writer is that he uses his writing for a purpose. He uses his platform to teach readers that “their past- with all its imperfections- was not one long night of savagery from which the first Europeans acting on God’s behalf delivered to them” (Ojaude 171). Achebe sets out to contradict the belief that African societies were mindless, that in fact they have philosophy of great depth and value and beauty - he contradicts the European negation of African humanity in the 18th and 19th centuries. To modern Africans, much of the beauty of a work of art and the pleasure one takes from it derives from the social usefulness of the work. To modern Africans a writer should be a social activist, which Achebe has exhibited on many occasions. Achebe has used his platform to address colonialism, to show African culture and traditions in an aesthetically pleasing way, and to represent Africa to the rest of the world from an African perspective. Drawing back to Na’allah’s interview with Achebe, Achebe explains not only the role he plays in African Literature but also the importance of African literature alone. How detrimental “the necessity for the world to understand the story of Africans not as represented by visiting Europeans but as seen and told by Africans themselves” (192). By making his writing and his art have social utility, Achebe is not only awarded high prestige and respect from the people of Africa, but also high prestige and respect from the rest of the world. 
        One can also see the extent to which Achebe was locally and globally respected as a writer in African literature by the attention he was granted when he passed away. One newspaper article published in the New York Amsterdam News titled their tribute to him: “Father of African Literature, Chinua Achebe, Dead at 82.” The fact alone that Achebe’s death gained attention not only African news but also the United States news, shows the extent to which he was such a renowned writer. The newspaper’s tribute to Achebe elaborated how Chinua Achebe’s name soared above all others to the readers and students of African literature. The article explains how Achebe set the pace for the arrival of other African writers and how he was seen as the “Father of African Literature.” Being awarded such a title more than constitutes why Achebe was such a distinguished writer in African Literature.  
In lecture, Professor Akudinobi defined the term “negritude.” Negritude is a term given by a French African person to describe the African perspective. It is a term used to unite African peoples. Achebe utilizes negritude in all his works offering a new perspective of African customs and traditions. Achebe is able to take back his culture and and portray it in the way that be believes it is. We see Achebe’s implementation of oral tradition in his novel “Things Fall Apart,” also upholding and demonstrating the songs and traditions of his culture. Oral literature has various purposes such as to teach, to uphold values, to offer narrative to customs, etc.  There has always been a divide in the idea of the civilized and the African, or the educated versus the African, or the pure versus the African. Achebe sets out to blur or diminish these divisions by utilizing negritude and exerting that in his writing. 
Achebe’s work explores issues such as race, gender, class, identity, form, style, culture, narrative and more in Africa. He raises and brings to attention substantive issues in all his texts especially in his novel “Things Fall Apart.” Achebe not only introduces the world to African literature but he does so from an African perspective rather than an outsider's perspective- which was new. He challenges several things such as colonization, canonization, and more that was imposed on African societies. By bringing purpose to his writing Achebe is highly respected in his native homeland and globally - thus a highly distinguished writer in African literature. He is able to portray his native traditions and customs to the rest of the world. He is also able to path the way for new African writers to come. For all these reasons that is why Chinua Achebe earns the title “Father of African literature.” That is why he is such a distinguished writer in this narrative and genre of writing.
