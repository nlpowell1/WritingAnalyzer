    "# Statistical Analysis of Writing \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I decided to create a tool that analyzes writing level and style using the Flesch-Kincaid index, average sentence length and the standard deviation within that, as well as repetitiveness of word use. When I was in high school, I had an English teacher tell my class that a good way to keep a reader engaged was to make sure the sentences in your writing varied in length and that you did not start too many of your sentences with the same word. In order to do this in his class, we would manually count the words of our sentences when editing as well as go through our work and circle the first word to make sure we were not being too repetitive. To this day I still use this technique, as I find it is an excellent and easy way to imrove my writing. So, I thought it would be a great project idea to create a program that would speed up the process!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flesch-Kincaid readability tests are two different tests that indicate the reading ease and suggested grade level of writing. The reading ease test will return a number between _zero_ and _one hundred_, the higher the number corresponds inversley to the texts reading ease. It uses this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\ 206.835 - 1.015( Total Words / Total Sentences ) - 84.6( Total Syllables / Total Words )\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart below illustrates the correlation between the reading ease score and the level of difficulty of the writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Reading Ease](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/broaSYuKWSgDp6GEcuVKd76Jt_AeHFi26vqRMyfs0uZV1FmTkvehJZ1oerWAb4uIEnj_bRXWw0dYOBlhkDpfKHFjt4gZD1_u5b0nGK8yZWAvSIzt-Cd_TFUf4IZLG08Y37IO5jce)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the grade level text will return a number that corresponds with the American grade level the text is estimated to be able to be read at. This test uses this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\ 0.39( Total Words / Total Sentences ) + 11.8( Total Syllables / Total Words ) - 15.59\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "My search to find data on the ideal sentence length and variation came up pretty slim. However, I did find a tool online for purchase which measured the sentence length of your writing and its standard deviation called ProWritingAid. I did not choose to purchase this program, but I did find that they provided a brief explanation in one of their demonstrations that gave some decent information on the topic. According to them, most published writer vary their sentences on average between eleven and eighteen words. Any more would be too complicated and any less would be too choppy. These seemed like decent enough numbers for me to go off of, and so I began..."

    "\n",
    "Overall, I am pretty happy with how this program turned out. However, one limitation of my design is that although it does come up with a calculated grade level score, it does not actually check the correctness of the writing or give feedback on specific style or syntax. Continuing,  I would like to investigate further if there were ways return the text marked up with any sentences that were outliers in terms of length or structure. This would provide the user with much more specific areas that need correction. \n",
    "\n",
    "One tool I would like to look into more in the future for this is spacy. I am really intrigued by spacy and I think if I had more time with it I would be able to do a lot to further my project and look deeper into analyzing and editing sentence structure and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I believe I could make this program more useful by collecting works of recognized authors and scholars and seeing if I could find a correlation between their sentence length and structure, or perhaps similarities across disciplines. \n",
    "\n",
    "But despite its limitations, I believe my project was successful. I gained more confidence with Python and created something that will actually be useful to myself and others. Already by looking at the sentence length for all of the pieces that I contributed I can see that I tend to write sentences that are a bit too lengthy, at least according to ProWritingAid... Seeing the data lined up together was very interesting to me, and my friends and I liked being able to see what level we are supposedly writing at. I am excited to continue with Python and see what else I can create!"
